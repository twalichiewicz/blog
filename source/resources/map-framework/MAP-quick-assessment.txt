# MAP Framework Quick Assessment Tool

Use this tool to evaluate if your team is ready for the MAP Framework or to assess how well you're implementing it.

## Current State Assessment

### How does your team currently sequence work?

**Traditional Approach (Score 0-1 per item)**
- [ ] Product defines requirements first
- [ ] Design makes those requirements usable
- [ ] Engineering builds what's specified
- [ ] Changes require going back to start
- [ ] Designers work in isolation until handoff

**MAP Approach (Score 2-3 per item)**
- [ ] Design explores solution space first
- [ ] Product assesses and prioritizes options
- [ ] Engineering is involved throughout
- [ ] Iteration happens within phases
- [ ] Cross-functional collaboration from day 1

**Total Score: _____ / 15**

## Implementation Roadmap

Based on your scores, here's your recommended path:

### Score 0-7: Foundation Building
Start with:
1. Design literacy workshops for PM/Eng
2. Include designers in planning meetings
3. Pilot MAP on one small project
4. Document and share learnings

### Score 8-15: Ready for Pilot
Start with:
1. Choose a medium-complexity project
2. Run full MAP workshop
3. Track metrics vs. traditional approach
4. Adjust process based on feedback

### Score 16-25: Scale Implementation
Start with:
1. Standardize MAP across teams
2. Create playbooks and templates
3. Train new team members
4. Measure long-term impact

## Red Flags to Watch

**During Mapping**
- [ ] Designers creating in a vacuum
- [ ] No technical input on feasibility
- [ ] Skipping user research
- [ ] Over-polishing too early

**During Assessment**
- [ ] Choosing based on opinion vs. data
- [ ] Ignoring technical complexity
- [ ] Unrealistic timelines
- [ ] No clear success metrics

**During Production**
- [ ] Designs changing significantly
- [ ] Engineers confused about intent
- [ ] Scope creep from new ideas
- [ ] Quality sacrificed for speed

---

## Success Indicators

You know MAP is working when:

### Short-term (1-3 months)
- [ ] Fewer mid-project pivots
- [ ] Engineers asking "why" not just "what"
- [ ] PMs comparing options not defining features
- [ ] Designers showing multiple approaches

### Long-term (6-12 months)
- [ ] Improved user satisfaction scores
- [ ] Reduced support tickets
- [ ] Faster time-to-market
- [ ] Higher team morale
- [ ] More innovative solutions

## Next Steps

1. **Score 0-10**: Focus on team education and small experiments
2. **Score 11-20**: Run a pilot project with external facilitation
3. **Score 21-25**: You're ready! Use the workshop template to get started

Remember: MAP is a journey, not a destination. Even experienced teams continue refining their approach.
