I'm actually surprised I haven't already seen this yet:

- In apartment buildings your garage is often far from your front door
- These wagons have become incredibly popular for this reason, and they're honestly a great solution for large shopping trips
- In many cars there is usually already a space under the floor of the trunk for a spare tire, with some reconfiguration a tunnel could fit to hold the collapsed wagon
