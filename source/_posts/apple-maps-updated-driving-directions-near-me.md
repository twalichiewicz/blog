Apple Maps inaccurately directed me on a longer route due to a one-way street misidentification. Discovered the error while driving, reported it, and it was recently fixed, saving 5 minutes.

It does make me wonder about how widespread errors are in Apple Maps data. I wonder if there would be a benefit in supporting user contributions to address such issues efficiently. Maybe some sort of opt-in feature for Maps capturing detailed data to enhance routing and updates?
