Apple Music's autoplay feature would be so much better if it remembered what you've already heard in your current session. Nothing worse than it queuing up the same "recommended" songs that just played 30 minutes ago when you were in a different playlist.

Maybe keep track of the last 50 songs played? Just a thought.
