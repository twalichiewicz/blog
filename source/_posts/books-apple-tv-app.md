It's puzzling that Apple hasn't introduced a Books app for Apple TV. Our TVs have become the modern hearth, so why not recreate the experience of reading around the fireplace?

Imagine an Apple TV Books app that brings audiobooks to the big screen, turning stories into shared experiences. Families could gather to listen together, with synchronized visuals enhancing the narrativeâ€”perfect for kids' books and interactive tales.

Even better, incorporating voice-to-text would let you enjoy any book audibly, leaving dynamic bookmarks so you can pick up right where you left off. It could also be a game-changer for education, making group discussions and interactive lessons more engaging.

Bringing Books to Apple TV could merge technology with tradition, creating a modern storytelling circle around our digital hearth.
