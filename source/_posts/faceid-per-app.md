This new FaceID per app feature in iOS should really be enabled by default for any of the communication apps (Messages, Phone, Email), since they not only provide an opportunity to onboard the user to the feature, those apps are the most damaging if a bad actor got your hands on your device*.

*Obviously this could be different person-to-person, but those three I would estimate everyone wants some control over the means by which we communicate to other people.
