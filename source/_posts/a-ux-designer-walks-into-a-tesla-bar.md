Via [Scott Jenson](https://jenson.org/tesla/):

> Most importantly, in 99% of cars on the road today, I don’t need to RTFM to turn steer, accelerate, brake, use the turn signals, or turn on the damn defroster. That’s why these things are standardized. There are lots of things I will likely need the manual for but not these basics. The v11 design broke this.

Standardization exists for a reason. When basics become complex (due to clearly baseless modifications), user experience suffers.

*This doesn't appear to be fixed in v12, FYI.*
