**Welcome to the new blog! ðŸŽ‰**
After way too long, I've gotten around to releasing this MVP of the redesigned portfolio site. Some stuff is still broken, and there is an entirely separate desktop version that is still under construction. I'm excited to reveal some of the redesigned project write-ups, but I didn't want to delay the larger release any longer.

<h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;margin-bottom: -15px;">What's new:</h3>

- Separate mobile and desktop versions
- Simplified to a monopage design
- Sexy new color scheme
- Handling for post-types (links, projects, etc.)
- Project write-ups have been redesigned
- Added some sound effects
- Lots of small quality-of-life improvements
