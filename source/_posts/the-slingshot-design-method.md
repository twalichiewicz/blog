**Slingshot Design**

Envision your design process as pulling back a slingshot, meticulously setting parameters and direction. Release the tension, propelling development swiftly toward the target with minor adjustments within the slingshot's vectors.

Evaluate the impact:

1. Direct hit but standing: Amplify resources and extend MVP for a more impactful follow-up.
2. Missed target (degree noted): Refine your aim without starting over, leveraging existing documentation and making adjustments for a more accurate shot.
