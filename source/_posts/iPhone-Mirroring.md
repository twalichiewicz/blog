The iPhone Mirroring feature:
* Is great for that-one-app-that-is-only-on-mobile
* Introduces a new paradigm for showing / hiding the window controls, could use a little affordance but pretty slick
* Sort of makes me wonder why even show the home screen at all? You could probably get away with integrating the hardware to be recognized as native to the Mac and the apps alongside the native ones
