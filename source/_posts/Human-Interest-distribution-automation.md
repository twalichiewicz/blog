### Opportunity

Human Interest's 401(k) distribution process was stuck in the pastâ€”arduous, paper-based, and inefficient. The challenge was to modernize this outdated process with a digital automation solution, streamlining the distribution request experience for users.

### Process & Key Findings

I started by mapping the existing paper workflow and gathering feedback from users who found the process slow and cumbersome. Key insights included:

- **Inefficiency**: The manual, paper mailing process was time-consuming and error-prone.
- **User Frustration**: Users struggled with outdated forms and unclear instructions.
- **Digital Potential**: A well-designed, automated digital form could significantly simplify the experience.

### Design & Execution

I developed an automated distribution request form that replaced the old paper process:

- **Guided Digital Flow**: The solution walks users through each step, ensuring all necessary information is captured efficiently.
- **Backend Integration**: The automation streamlines data collection and processing, speeding up the entire distribution request process.

### Key Deliverables

- **Automated Distribution Request Form**: A fully digital, interactive form that simplifies the process.
- **User Flow Documentation & Prototypes**: Detailed prototypes and user flow maps that validate the streamlined process.
- **Integration Blueprint**: A plan for seamless backend integration to automate data processing.

### Outcomes

The automated form transformed the distribution request process:

- **Faster Turnaround**: Reduced processing times by eliminating manual paperwork.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Simplified and intuitive interface significantly lowered user frustration.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated data collection and processing paved the way for scalable improvements in customer service.
