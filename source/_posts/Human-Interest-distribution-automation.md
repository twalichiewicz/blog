## Process & Design Approach

The project began with a comprehensive analysis of the existing paper-based workflow. Through user interviews and process mapping, I identified key pain points in both the customer experience and operational efficiency. This research informed the design of a digital-first solution that would transform the entire distribution request process.

## Technical Implementation

Working closely with engineering teams, I designed a system that combined user-friendly frontend interfaces with robust backend automation. The solution featured real-time validation, automated data processing, and seamless integration with existing systems. The implementation focused on creating a reliable, scalable platform that could handle distribution requests efficiently while maintaining strict compliance requirements.

## Results & Impact

The automated distribution system fundamentally transformed how Human Interest handled 401(k) distribution requests. Users benefited from a simplified, intuitive process that reduced frustration and confusion. Meanwhile, the operations team gained efficiency through automated processing and validation. The system's success demonstrated the value of digital transformation in financial services, setting a new standard for retirement account management.
