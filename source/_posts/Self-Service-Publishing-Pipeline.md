## The Problem

Autodesk's smart support system could monitor user behavior and deliver contextual guidance, but publishing new content required full engineering cycles. Every tutorial, efficiency tip, or onboarding flow needed scheduled meetings, resource allocation, wiki documentation, and cross-team coordination. This meant intelligent features that could help millions of users were bottlenecked by a process designed for major feature releases.

## The Solution

I designed a self-service publishing platform that transforms content creation from engineering projects into simple form submissions. Content creators can now build contextual guidance using a WYSIWYG editor, see live previews, and publish directly to millions of usersâ€”all without touching code.

## Key Innovation: Engineering-to-Form Transformation

- **Process Mapping**: Analyzed the entire stakeholder lifecycle for creating one "Insight" and automated every step
- **WYSIWYG Content Builder**: Live preview editor that shows exactly how content will appear in-product
- **Automated Publishing Pipeline**: Form submission triggers the entire technical process that previously required engineering coordination
- **Smart Context Targeting**: Content automatically surfaces to relevant users based on behavioral monitoring
- **Semi-Autonomous Publication**: Built-in review workflows with rollback capabilities eliminate dev dependency

## Impact

- Reduced content publishing time by 60% (weeks to hours)
- Democratized content creation across non-technical teams
- Eliminated engineering bottlenecks for contextual guidance features
- Enabled rapid iteration on user onboarding and support experiences
- Scaled intelligent assistance to millions of users through streamlined content pipeline
