### Opportunity

Autodesk wanted to deliver intelligent, contextual product experiences—such as personalized onboarding, how-to guides, and performance improvement suggestions ("Insights")—but the publishing pipeline was only accessible to engineers. This made iteration slow and disconnected non-technical stakeholders from user experience delivery.

### Process & Key Findings

User journey mapping and internal interviews revealed:

- **Engineering Bottlenecks**: Content updates required full dev cycles.
- **Low Visibility**: Non-technical teams lacked confidence in publishing outcomes.
- **Fragmented Approval Processes**: No clear way to manage reviews and rollback.

### Design & Execution

I built a self-service visual publishing platform:

- **Workflow-Driven UX**: Guided authors through creation, review, and launch.
- **Preview and Rollback**: Ensured safe publishing without dev dependency.
- **Localization Support**: Integrated pipelines for global audience rollout.

### Key Deliverables

- Insight publishing interface with structured workflows
- Validation logic, permissioning models, and preview environments
- UX documentation and specs for cross-team implementation

### Outcomes

- Reduced Insight content publish time by 60%
- Enabled non-technical teams to ship onboarding and guidance content independently
- Increased iteration speed and personalization capabilities
