<div style="text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word; max-width: 350px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
	In the realm where clicks and swipes hold sway,<br/>
2023 bids design to play.<br/>
A dance of pixels, seamless and refined,<br/>
As interfaces evolve, innovation intertwined.<br/>
<br/>
Gestures whisper, a tactile ballet,<br/>
User journeys mapped in a vibrant display.<br/>
From dark modes sleek to gradients bold,<br/>
Designers weave stories, a tale to be told.<br/>
<br/>
Into 2024, the canvas expands,<br/>
Augmented realities and intuitive hands.<br/>
With empathy as ink, and pixels as lore,<br/>
Experience design evolves, a symphony evermore. 🍃
