Some thoughts after reading [this great blog post from Columbia's Stats blog:](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/11/18/i-disagree-with-geoff-hinton-regarding-glorified-autocomplete/)

Where we are today, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become skilled at mimicking human intuitionâ€” taking into consideration all of the individual's _(well, the LLM's scraping of the internet, in this case)_ experiences and perceptions and providing heuristic responses to prompts.

What's _really_ exiting is as we move out of the nascent phase of LLM AI we can now attempt to recreate the higher level of human cognition: reasoning. The question now is which LLM AI product will be the one to realize that a large investment in bringing in psychologists will help them reach that goal first?
