As anyone who has worked in tech knows, Minimum Viable Product (MVP) solutions are _the_ popular approach for launching new products. But after a decade in the industry, I think that releasing products in an MVP state to your customers is generally a mistake.

## The Hidden Cost of "Viable"

No customer wants to feel like they're paying to use something incomplete. When Google launched Gmail, it wasn't an MVP—it was a polished product with 1GB of storage when competitors offered 2-15MB. When Apple released the iPhone, it wasn't minimal—it redefined what a phone could be.

Contrast this with products that launched too early: Google Wave confused users with incomplete features. Color burned through $41 million because their MVP didn't make sense to anyone. Quibi's "quick bites" felt like a half-baked concept that no one asked for.

## The MVP Trap

The problem isn't the concept of starting small—it's what we've let MVP become:
- **Excuse for shipping broken features** ("We'll fix it later")
- **Justification for poor UX** ("Users will figure it out")
- **Cover for lack of vision** ("We'll see what sticks")

Your first impression isn't just about features. It's about trust. When Spotify launched, it had a limited catalog but the experience was flawless. When Slack entered a crowded market, it wasn't minimal—it was delightful.

## A Better Approach: The Complete Experience

Instead of Minimum Viable Product, think **Minimum Delightful Experience**:

**Focus relentlessly**: Ship one thing that works perfectly rather than five things that sort of work. Instagram started as just photo sharing—but it was the best photo sharing experience available.

**Polish what you ship**: Your limited feature set should feel intentional, not incomplete. Basecamp has famously kept their product simple, but every feature feels thoughtfully complete.

**Set expectations clearly**: If you're in beta, act like it. Don't charge full price for half a product. Discord grew by being free while they figured things out.

## When MVPs Actually Work

There are exceptions. MVPs work when:
- You're validating a truly new concept (Airbnb's air mattresses)
- You have a captive, forgiving audience (internal tools)
- The core value is immediately obvious (Twitter's 140 characters)
- You're transparent about the journey (Hey.com's public development)

But these are exceptions, not the rule.

## The Brand Debt You're Creating

Every time a user encounters a broken feature, slow performance, or confusing UX, you're taking out a loan against your brand. Unlike technical debt, brand debt compounds with interest:
- Users won't try your product again
- They'll tell others about their bad experience
- You'll need to spend more on marketing to overcome negative perception
- Your team will lose confidence in the product

## Key Takeaways

1. **Your MVP is your brand's first impression**—make it count. Users won't remember that you were "just getting started."

2. **Minimum ≠ Broken**—A skateboard is minimal transportation, but it should still roll smoothly.

3. **Delight beats features**—One thing that makes users smile beats ten things that frustrate them.

You can only launch once. Make it worth remembering for the right reasons.
