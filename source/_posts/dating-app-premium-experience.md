The dating app premium model (think HingeX, Tinder Gold, etc) is so lazyâ€” it's just about *not* hamstringing the experience by removing the profiles you would be actually interested in / removing the like restrictions to maintain daily/weekly/monthly usage numbers

Seems like the best thing they could offer would be a way to connect you with a dating coach who reviews your profile, helps you work on your conversation skills, etc. You could even flag that to potential dates so they know that this user is taking it more seriously.
