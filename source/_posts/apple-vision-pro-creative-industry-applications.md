I'm obviously going to be biased for my own industry when I think of the most immediate applications, but I'm really curious what new interaction patterns can be created when working with creative tools. (A comparable example from mobile interfaces were things like shake to undo, overscrolling the top to trigger a refresh, pinch gestures, etc.)
