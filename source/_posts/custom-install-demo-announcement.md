Just pushed a major update to the [Deploy at Scale demo](/Deploy-at-Scale/). You can now experience the actual custom installation system we built for Autodesk's enterprise customers.

The demo showcases product-specific customizationsâ€”AutoCAD gets security settings and trusted locations, Maya gets workspace configs and Python environments, Revit gets BIM 360 integration. Each product displays its own unique options, just like IT admins see in production.

What started as a static mockup now lets you:
- Build deployment packages with real product configurations
- See how 7,500+ IT admins manage 100,000+ enterprise seats
- Experience the UI that reduced deployment prep from days to minutes

The attention to detail matters here. When you select a product, the customization options change. When you toggle between Install and Deploy modes, the entire workflow adapts. It's these small interactions that made the difference between a tool people had to use and one they wanted to use.

[Try the demo](/Deploy-at-Scale/) and see how we made enterprise software deployment feel less like system administration and more like product design.
