I'm excited to share a new interactive demo that showcases the custom installation system we built for Autodesk's enterprise customers. This project transformed how IT administrators deploy software across thousands of workstations, reducing deployment preparation time from days to minutes.

## The Challenge

Enterprise IT teams managing Autodesk software deployments faced significant challenges:
- Creating custom installation packages required deep technical knowledge
- Each deployment configuration took days of manual scripting
- No visibility into package contents until deployment time
- Managing multiple product configurations was error-prone

## The Solution in Action

The [Deploy at Scale demo](/Deploy-at-Scale/) now features a fully interactive custom installation creator that demonstrates:

### Intelligent Package Creation
- Visual selection of products with real-time configuration
- Product-specific customizations that adapt to each software's unique requirements
- Smart defaults based on deployment type (end-user vs. IT admin)

### Enterprise-Ready Features
The demo showcases enterprise deployment capabilities including:
- Configurable folder structures and installation paths
- Security settings and trusted location management
- Support content and language pack selection
- Integration with enterprise authentication systems

### Real-World Impact
This system now powers deployments for:
- 100,000+ enterprise seats globally
- 7,500+ IT administrators
- Installation packages ranging from single products to complete suites

## Try It Yourself

Visit the [Deploy at Scale project page](/Deploy-at-Scale/) and click through the interactive demo to experience:

1. **Library Management** - Browse and manage existing deployment packages
2. **Package Creation** - Build custom installations with product-specific options
3. **Configuration Details** - See how different products require different customization approaches

The demo reflects the actual system's capabilities, from AutoCAD's security settings and trusted locations to Maya's workspace configuration and performance preferences. Each product shows contextually relevant options, just as IT administrators experience in production.

## Technical Highlights

What makes this demo special:
- **Product-Aware Customizations**: Each Autodesk product (AutoCAD, Revit, Maya, etc.) displays its own unique configuration options
- **Stateful Interactions**: The demo maintains state as you build packages, just like the real system
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and tablet devices

## Looking Forward

This project exemplifies how thoughtful UX design can transform complex enterprise workflows. By focusing on the IT administrator's journey, we created a system that's both powerful and approachable.

The success of this deployment system has opened doors for similar transformations across other enterprise software challenges. Stay tuned for more demos showcasing how we're making enterprise software more human-centered.
