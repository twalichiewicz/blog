### Opportunity

Human Interest needed a modern brand identity to reflect its innovative offerings and resonate with a contemporary audience. The existing visuals felt outdated, causing a disconnect with potential clients and undermining the company’s forward-thinking reputation.

### Process & Key Findings

A combination of market research and user interviews revealed that customers sought a cohesive, trustworthy brand experience. This data confirmed that an updated visual identity—paired with consistent messaging—would be key to improving engagement and establishing deeper trust.

### Design & Execution

Guided by these findings, we launched a full-scale rebranding initiative. The effort involved:

- Overhauling the logo, color palette, and typography to create a unified visual language
- Developing a comprehensive design system with clear guidelines for consistency across print and digital channels
- Revitalizing the company’s web presence through a complete redesign and implementation, ensuring an intuitive user experience
- Reimagining product interfaces for admin, user, and internal platforms to align with the new brand identity
- Expanding the brand across marketing collateral, trade show materials, and environmental graphics, ensuring a seamless experience in every context

#### Key deliverables included

- Strategic brand identity system (logo, color palette, typography)
- Comprehensive brand guidelines and design system documentation
- Proprietary icon library for product and marketing applications
- End-to-end website redesign and implementation
- Product interface redesign (admin, user, internal platforms)
- Integrated marketing and sales collateral system
- Trade show and event presence design
- Environmental graphics and workplace design

### Outcomes

- Enhanced brand recognition and customer engagement, thanks to a more cohesive, impactful visual identity
