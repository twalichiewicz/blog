As the lead designer for Human Interest's comprehensive brand transformation, I orchestrated the development and implementation of a cohesive design system that elevated the company's market presence and user experience.

This extensive rebranding initiative garnered industry recognition, earning [a feature in Brand New's "Spotted" section in February 2018](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_name_and_logo_for_human_interest.php). The project exemplifies the successful execution of a holistic design approach, completed within an ambitious six-month timeline.

Key deliverables included:

- Strategic brand identity system encompassing logo design, color palette, and typography
- Comprehensive brand guidelines and design system documentation
- Proprietary icon library for product and marketing applications
- End-to-end website redesign and implementation
- Product interface redesign across admin, user, and internal platforms
- Integrated marketing and sales collateral system
- Trade show and event presence design
- Environmental graphics and workplace design
- Brand merchandise and corporate identity applications
