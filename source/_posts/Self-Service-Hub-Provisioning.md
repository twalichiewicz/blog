### Opportunity

Administrators previously had to rely on customer support to provision new web instances—or "hubs"—for Autodesk’s cloud products, causing delays. The challenge was to create a self-service solution that aligns with their workflows and speeds up deployment.

### Design & Execution

I developed the Self-Service Hub Provisioning tool as an extension of the Common Project Administration dashboard:

- **Guided Onboarding:** A step-by-step wizard simplifies hub setup.
- **Streamlined Actions:** Complex processes were distilled into clear, intuitive steps.
- **Consistent Experience:** The tool integrated seamlessly with the existing administration interface.

### Key Deliverables

- **Provisioning Module:** An embedded interface for quick, self-service hub setup.
- **Interactive Wizard:** A guided flow ensuring efficient and accurate provisioning.
- **UX Documentation:** Detailed user flows and design rationale supporting the solution.

### Outcomes

The tool transformed the provisioning process:

- **Faster Deployment:** Hubs can now be provisioned instantly without support intervention.
- **Empowered Administrators:** Users gained greater control, leading to a more agile experience.
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** The streamlined process laid the groundwork for ongoing innovation in Autodesk’s cloud ecosystem.
