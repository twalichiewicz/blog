summary:
  problem:
    content: "Enterprise customers couldn't deploy new instances of Autodesk's web products without contacting customer support. Every new project, team, or deployment required a support ticket, manual provisioning by Autodesk staff, and days of waiting. This created massive friction for customers trying to scale their operations and overwhelmed support teams with routine infrastructure requests."
  solution:
    content: "I designed a self-service provisioning system that allows administrators to instantly generate and manage cloud instances of any Autodesk web product. What previously required support tickets and manual intervention now happens in minutes through an automated wizard interface."

## Research & Discovery

The provisioning bottleneck was creating significant friction for enterprise customers who needed to spin up new project environments quickly. Through customer interviews and support ticket analysis, I discovered that 60% of support requests were routine infrastructure provisioning tasks that could be automated.

## Design Process

I worked closely with infrastructure engineers to understand the technical requirements for cloud deployment while mapping out customer workflows. The challenge was abstracting complex infrastructure decisions into intuitive interface choices that non-technical administrators could confidently navigate.

## Solution Architecture

The self-service system breaks down complex cloud deployments into a guided wizard experience. Each step presents only the relevant choices for that stage, with smart defaults based on common enterprise configurations. The system handles all the underlying infrastructure orchestration while presenting a simple, linear workflow to users.

## Impact & Results

The transformation was immediate and dramatic. Enterprise customers could now scale their operations dynamically without delays, support teams could focus on complex technical issues rather than routine provisioning, and Autodesk gained a competitive advantage by offering infrastructure agility that other CAD vendors couldn't match.

The system proved so effective that it became the standard deployment method for all new Autodesk cloud products, establishing a scalable foundation for the company's cloud-first strategy.
