Considering how good iOS's image-to-text processing is (especially compared to competitors), Apple Maps should be able to convert menus into standardized POI metadata.

- For those that require assistive devices to read a menu, they could just load the restaurant POI
- Keeps users who are interested in delivery in the Apple Maps app longer, since they don't need to jump immediately to DoorDash to check the menu if a restaurant looks good
  - Eventually you should be able to order (via applet) directly from the Apple Maps POI card
- Assuming it's easy for a restaurant owner to upload the menu, it incentivizes businesses to engage with / update Apple Maps content
