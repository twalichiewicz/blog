Whoever is doing AppleTV+'s show marketing should be replaced. There have now been multiple occasions where the promotion/information about a show in the guide has actively discouraged me from watching it, only for me to find, when giving it a shot randomly, that it's actually a high-quality show.

They're doing a disservice to the show's creators.
