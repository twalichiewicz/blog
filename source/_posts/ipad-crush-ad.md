I know I'm late to the commentary party, but who the hell at Apple saw [that iPad crush ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntjkwIXWtrc) and thought, "Yep, good to go"?

Super tone deaf, and the idea itself was totally salvageable if they had been a little more creative with the imagery.

[Not to mention this exact idea has been done before.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzAo9HzOgtQ)
