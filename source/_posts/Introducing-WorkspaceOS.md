I'm excited to share [WorkspaceOS](https://tryworkspaceos.com) – a new approach to managing your digital workspace that I've been working on.

## What is WorkspaceOS?

WorkspaceOS reimagines how we interact with our digital tools and workflows. Instead of juggling dozens of apps and browser tabs, it creates a unified workspace where everything works together seamlessly.

## Key Features

**Smart Organization** – Your projects, files, and communications organize themselves based on context and relevance.

**Unified Search** – Find anything across all your tools instantly, without switching between apps.

**Workflow Automation** – Common tasks and routines happen automatically in the background.

**Privacy-First** – Your data stays yours. No training AI models on your work.

## Why Now?

After years of designing interfaces and building tools, I kept seeing the same pattern: people spending more time managing their tools than using them. WorkspaceOS is my attempt to flip that equation.

Check it out at [tryworkspaceos.com](https://tryworkspaceos.com) and let me know what you think.
