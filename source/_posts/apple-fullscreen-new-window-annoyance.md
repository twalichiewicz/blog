Apple's current approach to fullscreen apps often leaves users with a fragmented experience, especially when new windows are involved. It’s almost like that 'forgetting why I entered the room' effect—each time you’re forced to switch between spaces, it disrupts your focus and makes it harder to stay on task.

A more cohesive approach would be for the OS to support functionality that keeps new windows within the same fullscreen space. For instance, imagine an option to open new windows in a side panel, modal, or integrated split view within the existing fullscreen environment. The specifics aren't as important as the need for a smoother, more intuitive way to manage windows in fullscreen mode. A redesigned experience like this would allow for better task continuity and a more productive workflow overall.
