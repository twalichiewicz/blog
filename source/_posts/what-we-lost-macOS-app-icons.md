While I appreciate a lot of the improvements to macOS's visual language—like the slick animations and cleaner interfaces—I can't forgive the damn move away from those bespoke, semi-skeuomorphic app icons. Seriously, it's mind-numbing to see a row of soulless rectangles staring back at me. They're not highway signs; they don't need to be that standardized. Where's the charm? The personality?
