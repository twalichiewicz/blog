Designers who hide behind rigid processes and endless documentation stifle creativity and churn out uninspired designs that miss the mark.

In the 2010s, many designers lacked the depth needed to excel, relying on frameworks instead of honing their intuition. Now, they've climbed the ranks, enforcing ineffective policies that suffocate innovation. They demand more research and documentation, frustrating those with the vision to make real change.

Recent layoffs have weeded out many of these "B players." Now is the time for the design industry to refocus on genuine growth and mentorship. Experienced designers should be valued for their expertise and encouraged to guide newcomers, fostering intuition and leadership skills. Companies should prioritize continuous learning and balance structured methods with intuitive decision-making.

By embracing mentorship and ongoing growth, we can elevate design quality and move the industry forward. I think it's time to champion real expertise and prepare the next generation to lead with vision and creativity.
