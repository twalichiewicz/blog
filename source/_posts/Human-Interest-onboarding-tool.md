summary:
  problem:
    content: "Setting up a 401(k) plan for small businesses involves dozens of complex steps across weeks or months—employer documentation, employee eligibility rules, compliance requirements, payroll integration, and regulatory approvals. Customers were constantly calling to ask 'What's the status?' because they had no visibility into the multi-week process, overwhelming support teams with status inquiries."
  solution:
    content: "I designed a card-based visual onboarding system that transforms the complex 401(k) setup process into a clear, trackable journey. Each step becomes a visual card showing current status, next actions, and estimated timelines—even for steps requiring days of government processing."

    bullets:
      - "<strong>Visual Progress Cards:</strong> Complex regulatory steps broken into digestible, trackable components"
      - "<strong>Real-Time Status Updates:</strong> Customers can see exactly where their plan setup stands without calling support"
      - "<strong>Dependency Mapping:</strong> Clear indication of what's waiting on customer action vs. external processing"
      - "<strong>Timeline Expectations:</strong> Realistic timeframes for government approvals and regulatory requirements"
      - "<strong>Proactive Communication:</strong> System notifies customers when action is needed or when delays occur"
  impact:
    bullets:
      - "Reduced support case volume by 30%"
      - "Eliminated 'status check' calls and emails that consumed support team time"
      - "Improved customer satisfaction through transparency and control"
      - "Enhanced brand perception - reinforced 'white glove' positioning through superior experience"
      - "Tool was so effective that customers asked to license it for their own products"

## Research & User Insights

The 401(k) setup process involves multiple external dependencies—government approvals, payroll system integrations, and compliance reviews—that create natural delays. Through customer interviews, I discovered that the lack of visibility into these processes was more frustrating than the delays themselves.

## Design Process

I mapped out the entire 401(k) setup workflow, identifying every step that involved customer action versus external processing. The key insight was that customers needed to understand not just what was happening, but why certain steps take time and what they could do to accelerate the process.

## Solution Architecture

The card-based system breaks complex workflows into discrete, visual components. Each card shows the current state, what's needed next, and realistic timeline expectations. This transforms an opaque process into a transparent journey where customers feel informed and in control.

## Results & Customer Feedback

The impact was immediate and measurable. Support ticket volume dropped significantly, customer satisfaction scores improved, and the onboarding experience became a competitive differentiator for Human Interest.

The ultimate validation came during a team standup when our operations manager mentioned that a customer had actually asked if they could license the tool for their own product—proving we'd solved a universal problem with workflow transparency that extends far beyond 401(k) administration.
