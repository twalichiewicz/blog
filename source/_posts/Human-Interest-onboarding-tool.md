## The Problem

Setting up a 401(k) plan for small businesses involves dozens of complex steps across weeks or months—employer documentation, employee eligibility rules, compliance requirements, payroll integration, and regulatory approvals. Customers were constantly calling to ask "What's the status?" because they had no visibility into the multi-week process, overwhelming support teams with status inquiries.

## The Solution

I designed a card-based visual onboarding system that transforms the complex 401(k) setup process into a clear, trackable journey. Each step becomes a visual card showing current status, next actions, and estimated timelines—even for steps requiring days of government processing.

## Key Innovation: Status Transparency for Complex Workflows

- **Visual Progress Cards**: Complex regulatory steps broken into digestible, trackable components
- **Real-Time Status Updates**: Customers can see exactly where their plan setup stands without calling support
- **Dependency Mapping**: Clear indication of what's waiting on customer action vs. external processing
- **Timeline Expectations**: Realistic timeframes for government approvals and regulatory requirements
- **Proactive Communication**: System notifies customers when action is needed or when delays occur

## Impact

- Reduced support case volume by <30%
- Eliminated "status check" calls and emails that consumed support team time
- Improved customer satisfaction through transparency and control
- Enhanced brand perception - reinforced "white glove" positioning through superior experience

**Fun Fact:** The onboarding experience was so intuitive and effective that during a team standup, our operations manager mentioned a customer had actually asked if they could license the tool for their own product—the ultimate validation that we'd solved a universal problem.
