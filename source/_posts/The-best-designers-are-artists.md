> Not all designers are artists. In fact, most designers arenâ€™t artists and thatâ€™s perfectly fine. But the best designers are indeed artists. And that's the difference. For the most talented, successful designers in the industry, art is the secret ingredient that takes their work to the next level.

This echoes my own feelings about recognizing the best designers.

Their approach to problem-solving is often rooted in their personal expression and creativity, and this humanity is apparent in their work. Artistry requires comfort in ambiguity, and those who are not confident in that space tend to rely solely on data to guide their decisions. This approach can result in underwhelming final products that lack the spark and personality of designs created by more intuitive and imaginative designers.
