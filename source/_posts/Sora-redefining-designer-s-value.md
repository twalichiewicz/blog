[This entire landing page](<https://sora.com/g/gen_01jq93q70jem0rwpd998m4jdj2>) was made from a single paragraph of text. 🤯

No mockups, no wireframes, and no hours of pixel pushing.
Just a ~200-word prompt, and Sora generated everything: layout, visuals, illustration, copy tone, and UX flow.

That is the new baseline.

If you’re a designer, this is now your competition. Not just other designers, but AI models that can deliver polished work instantly, trained on millions of examples and immune to burnout.

But here’s the thing: AI can replicate taste, yet it cannot replicate care. And this is an opportunity to redefine your value.

Much like McDonald’s feeds billions while people still line up for fine dining, craft still matters.

The human touch, the intuition, and the ability to build something that is right for this moment, this context, and this feeling are what make great design irreplaceable.

The designers who stand out now are the ones who:
 · Design for how people feel, not just what they do
 · Tailor experiences to real, specific human contexts
 · Build things that matter, not just things that look good
 · Lead with clarity and vision instead of merely generating screens
 · Collaborate deeply with stakeholders to solve problems AI can't fully comprehend

Execution is becoming commoditized. Your value is your judgment, your taste, and your care.

That is your edge. (I've seen this firsthand when working with clients who value the strategic thinking behind designs, not just the visual output. 👨‍🎨)
