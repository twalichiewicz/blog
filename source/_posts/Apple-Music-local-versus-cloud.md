After all these years, **how** has the Apple Music team still not figured out a way to make it clear if you're looking at the Library (local content) versus Apple Music?

Sometimes I honestly wonder what everyone is even doing at a company this large...They barely put out anything, and bugs/design tech persist for decades.
