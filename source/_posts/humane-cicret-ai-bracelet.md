Looks like the reviews are coming out for the Humane Ai Pin, and the on-hand projection is as terrible as I would have expected when it was first announced.

I wonder if in all their design ideation they considered [this Captain Disillusion video from seven years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbgvSi35n6o) explaining exactly why this would be such a terrible idea?
