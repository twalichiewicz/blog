Interesting how Apple redesigned the Settings app in iOS 18:

- Explainers at the header of all the major sections
- First party apps are now equally discoverable to Third party apps, since they're all in the new "Apps" subcategory
- The seem to be developing a language where the background (blue versus grey background) of some of the sections seems to pertain to their controls
