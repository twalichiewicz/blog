One thing that I still haven't seen touch interfaces properly provide affordance for are secondary actions. Yes, you can access them by typically a long-press, but how does a user _know_ which items contain additional functionality?

**P.S.** _Onboarding modals or tooltips are a lazy excuse and if you thought that was an acceptable answer you are wrong._
