The first full reviews of the Vision Pro are coming out, and gotta say the use case for a go-anywhere-monitor-that-can-also-put-up-a-privacy-screen-but-also-doesn't-require-you-to-bring-along-other-peripherals is pretty compelling.

One thing I've noticed from watching [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaneSRqePVY) of the [review videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xI10SFgzQ8) is how everyone's gestures are very deliberate and precise right now. It reminds me of the early days of the iPhone, where everyone had to learn a new way of typing: with their thumbs.

EDIT: Got around to watching [The Verge's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdwaWxY11jQ). That's some serious production value.
