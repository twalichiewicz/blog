# Make Belly Happy, Fast

<!-- 1) HERO IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->

Ugg say: Tribe gather at big rock! Midday hunger here. If no fix soon, tribe get grumpy—maybe smash stuff. We do quick sprint to craft “Bread-Stack Thingy.” Idea: easy to make, easy to eat, no meltdown. Let’s do tribe-think now!

## Big Vision for Tribe

- **Goal:** Solve lunch crisis before sun high.  
- **Success Grunts:** How many tribe members say “Mmm” instead of “Ugh.” Must keep “Ugh” low!  
- **No Tooth-Breaking:** Move fast, not crack jaw. If meltdown happen, we pivot to leftover mammoth bone.

## Know Ugg (Caveman Persona)

<!-- 2) CAVEMAN PERSONA IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->

### Who Be Ugg?

- Big, hairy, short attention. Want quick meal.  
- Hate crumb mess, no time for big cleanup.

### What Ugg Fear?

- Belly rumble lead to rage.  
- Soggy bread fiasco = meltdown sadness.

### What Ugg Dream?

- Tasty food so tribe can paint caves in peace.  
- Maybe fancy sauce if berry bush not run dry.

### Ugg’s Big Cave-Story
>
> **"As hungry cave-person, I want stack of food in hand, so I not starve and keep eye on sabertooth."**

## Morning Grunt Meet (Daily Huddle)

<!-- 3) DAILY HUDDLE IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->
![Grug standup circle with multiple cavemen around a rock](path/to/grug-standup.jpg "Placeholder: Ugg, Grog, and Ogg in a daily standup")

**Ugg:** “Yesterday, me put boar meat on bread. Bread crumble too easy. Need sturdier base.”

**Grog (Tribe Task Boss):** “We add thicker bread idea to big tasks rock. Maybe toast bread on fire stone for extra tough.”

**Ogg (Design Shaman):** “Me try berry jam. Yummy but sticky. Put green leaf so jam not cling to fingers.”

Tribe all grunt in agreement, club-smack for emphasis. Midday sprint goal: finish bread-stack or meltdown ruin day.

## Break Down Bread-Stack (Tribe Sprint Plan)

### Gather Tasty Stuff

- Look for bread (wheat patch?), find leftover meat.  
- Check cave for green leaves—avoid moldy stuff.

### Danger Guard

- If bread too stale, do lettuce-wrap approach.  
- If no sauce found, run to berry bush for jam sub.

### Sun-Stick Limit

- Ugg handle bread. Grog fetch sauce. Must finish before one sun-stick pass (hour).

## Make & Tweak (Prototypes)

### Caveman Sketch (Rough Build)

- Put meat chunk on bread. Check crumb level, see if meltdown.  
- Skip sauce first—just gauge dryness or toughness.

### Fancy Version (Fancy Build)

- Add jam or sauce for big flavor.  
- Layer green leaf to stop sticky jam on hands.  
- Place top bread slice as final “chomp layer.”

### Quick Grunt Check

- Ugg bite. Assess chew friction, flavor balance.  
- If meltdown, tribe add new item on tasks rock or do mini-run fix (like more sauce or sturdier bread).

## Tribe Compare (Look at Other Lunch Options)

<!-- 5) COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->

### Gnaw on Mammoth Bone

**Pros:** Big protein, store easy  
**Cons:** Hard chew, can break tooth, not portable

### Rogue Berries

**Pros:** Quick snack  
**Cons:** Sticky, not fill belly. Berries vanish fast in tribe

### Lettuce Wrap

**Pros:** Crunchy, healthy vibe  
**Cons:** Leaf tear easy, sauce drips = meltdown sad

**Verdict:** Bread-stack best for agile tribe. Fast, tasty, meltdown less likely.

## Tribe Taste Test (Acceptance Check)

<!-- 6) USER TESTING IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->
![Small group of Grugs biting into sandwiches, some happy, one meltdown](path/to/grug-testing.jpg "Placeholder: Tribe sampling bread-stack")

**Test Group:** 3–4 tribe members

### 'Mmm' Score

- Do they grunt “Mmm” with happy face?  
- Bread stay strong mid-bite?  
- Sauce not dribble on furry chest?

### Caveman Metrics

- “Time-to-first-bite” under two big grunts.  
- Crumb-to-napkin ratio is nice and small.

If tribe mostly say “Mmm,” success. If meltdown, do next iteration: less sauce, better bread, or strong leaf shield.

## Launch & Eat (Go-Live)

### Hand Over Food

Careful pass of bread-stack to user. Observe real-time munch.

### Watch for Crumbs

- Count bites before bread break.  
- Check tribe mood: big grin or meltdown tears?  
- If half-eaten sandwich remain, meltdown big fail.

## After-Meal Fire Talk (Retrospective)

<!-- 7) RETROSPECTIVE IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->

### Good Stuff

- Quick assembly, bread hold strong, crumb meltdown minimal.  
- Tribe happy, no random spear-throw from hunger rage.

### Next Time Better

- Maybe toast on hotter flame rock for crispy edge.  
- Possibly add second sauce layer for extra “Mmm.”

### Action Rocks

- Ugg update “Ingredient Rock List” with pickles, herbs, other fancy bites.  
- Next time, pair-chomp testing to refine bread-meat ratio.

Tribe finish with chest-thump victory dance. No midday meltdown = big success!

## Big Final Thought

<!-- 8) CONCLUSION IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->
![Grug with a proud look, holding a successful sandwich aloft](path/to/grug-conclusion.jpg "Placeholder: Triumphant Grug with sandwich")

By mixing primal ways with “fancy agile method,” we build a **Minimum Viable Sandwich** that keep belly happy. Ugg’s big grunt confirm success. Next sprint, we test jam distribution or try super-toasting for next-level flavor. Because even caveman know: **iterate or meltdown**. More improvement, more “Mmm.”

**Ugg say:** Now tribe can eat, not starve, keep painting cave walls. Grunt. Thump chest. End of grunt meet!
