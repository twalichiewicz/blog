I see a ton of nothingburger articles about AI and design every day, so I figured I'd throw my two cents into the void.

Lately, I've been deep in the weeds building enterprise systems to automate complicated, laborious, mission-critical work:

- AI/ML tooling pipelines  
- Product instance generators  
- Standardized installers across 60+ enterprise tools  

*(Sexy stuff, I know.)*

At their core, each of these projects solved a human-level problem: eliminate waste and free people from repetitive tasks so they can focus on decisions that actually matter.

In that same spirit, I turned the lens on myself—and put together real-life release notes for the latest version of me:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td><p><b>Product Designer 2.5 - Release Notes</b></p></td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="max-width: 175px;"><span class="tag">Updated</span>I explore more broadly</th>
    <td>I use AI to spin up multiple design directions and pressure-test concepts early—less about "more options," more about sharpening judgment on why one direction wins.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="max-width: 175px;"><span class="tag">Updated</span>I automate repetitive work</th>
    <td>Instead of hand-coding elements or rewriting copy for every variant, I script reusable components and use LLMs to translate content across use cases. That lets me stay focused on systems, not scaffolding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="max-width: 175px;"><span class="tag">Updated</span>I get to clarity faster</th>
    <td>AI helps me burn through early noise so I hit friction points sooner. That's where meaningful design decisions actually begin.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="max-width: 175px;"><span class="tag tag--new">New</span>I redefine the problem space and embed earlier</th>
    <td>With less time spent in production, I go upstream—reframing what should even exist. I dig into overlooked workflows, unmet needs, and the ripple effects of product decisions. The best design isn't always a better UI. Sometimes it's changing the brief entirely.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="max-width: 175px;"><span class="tag tag--new">New</span>I design for second- and third-order effects</th>
    <td>I think more about scale, team ops, and behavior. What happens when this pattern gets reused 10,000 times? What kind of culture are we shaping? It's not just usability anymore—it's long-term coherence and trust.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="max-width: 175px;"><span class="tag tag--new">New</span>I shape vision through prototypes, not slides</th>
    <td>Fully interactive prototypes in hours. I use them to pitch bolder, more abstract ideas—the kind that usually get dismissed for being "too big" or "too early." Now I can show, not just tell.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="max-width: 175px;"><span class="tag tag--new">New</span>I create reusable thinking, not just reusable components</th>
    <td>Beyond design systems, I document principles, tradeoffs, and mental models—so others (not just designers) can make smarter decisions without reinventing the wheel.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Real AI Workflows in Practice

Here are specific ways I'm using AI tools today:

### Rapid Concept Validation
- **Tool**: Claude + Figma
- **Workflow**: Feed existing designs into Claude → Generate 5 conceptual variations → Import as wireframes → Test with users in <2 hours
- **Impact**: What used to take 2 days now takes 2 hours

### Component Documentation
- **Tool**: GitHub Copilot + Custom Scripts
- **Workflow**: Write component specs in natural language → Auto-generate JSDoc comments → Create usage examples → Update design system docs
- **Impact**: 80% reduction in documentation time

### User Research Synthesis
- **Tool**: GPT-4 + Notion
- **Workflow**: Transcribe interviews → Extract themes → Map to existing personas → Generate insight reports with quotes
- **Impact**: Turn 20 hours of interviews into actionable insights in 30 minutes

### Design QA Automation
- **Tool**: Custom Python scripts + Vision APIs
- **Workflow**: Screenshot implementations → Compare to design files → Flag spacing/color/typography mismatches → Generate fix tickets
- **Impact**: Catch 95% of visual bugs before they ship

### Accessibility Testing
- **Tool**: AI-powered browser extensions
- **Workflow**: Run designs through contrast checkers → Generate ARIA labels → Suggest keyboard navigation improvements
- **Impact**: Ship more accessible products without manual audits

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI amplifies judgment, not just output** - The value isn't in generating more options, but in reaching meaningful design decisions faster

2. **Automation creates space for strategy** - Less time on production means more time understanding second-order effects and long-term impact

3. **Show, don't tell becomes scalable** - Interactive prototypes in hours means bolder ideas get real consideration instead of dying in committee
