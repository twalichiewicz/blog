[via Figma's blog:](https://www.figma.com/blog/a-new-collaboration-with-adobe/)

> Today, we’re announcing that Figma has entered into an agreement to be acquired by Adobe. This has been in the works over the past few months and I’m so excited to finally share this news with the world.

This is great news for all those Figma alternatives out there. I’m currently exploring Penpot for example.
