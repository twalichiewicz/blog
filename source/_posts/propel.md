      <h2>The Full Story</h2>
      <div class="long-form-content">
        <p> Long form story:

  There are over 45.8 million people (roughly 1 in 7 individuals in the US) who benefit from the
  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This is a critical program in the United
  States as 50% of Americans will be eligible for SNAP at some point during their lifetime. The
  program helps low-income families by giving them a monthly food allowance of $250 on
  average per household.

  These benefits are administered on a monthly basis. This design has negative consequences
  on behavior as it creates a “windfall” effect, leading people to temporarily disregard their
  future expenses. Especially after a period of scarcity, the deposit of a monthly lump sum can
  lead to overspending and misappropriate spending. For example, in Peru, when the
  government assistance moved from twice-a-month to monthly payments, they saw a 70% increase in the purchase of alcohol and sweets. (Note: In the U.S. SNAP benefits cannot be used for alcohol, but only for groceries.) This monthly lump sum creates what we call a “feed
  and famine” cycle, where according to the USDA, many families run out of their SNAP benefits
  mid-month. Studies have shown caloric intake decreases through the benefit month,
  contradicting claims that bulk buying is oﬀsetting the front-loaded spending.

  To understand how we can help SNAP recipients budget their benefits more eﬀectively, we
  partnered with Propel, the fin-tech startup in New York behind “Fresh EBT,” a mobile app where SNAP
  food stamp recipients can check their balance and transaction history. SNAP recipients typically
  have to save receipts or call a phone line to find their balances, but with Fresh EBT, they can check
  their balances instantly, see recent transactions, find stores that accept EBT, make a shopping list,
  and access other useful resources.

  **Behavioral diagnosis**
  Common Cents partnered with Propel to
  create a database that analyzes users’
  spending patterns. Through this work, we
  analyzed over 20,000 users and over 260,000
  transactions. We conducted in-depth interviews with
  Propel employees, as well as industry experts in the
  field. Additionally, we are in the process of conducting
  qualitative interviews with a number of SNAP recipients.

  **Key insights**
  This deep data analysis allowed us to get meaningful insights into the spending behavior of SNAP
  recipients, including:

- **Small and frequent dollar purchases are the norm.**
  Most purchases made are small dollar purchases, with the average purchase totaling
  $30.94. Close to 20% of purchases were less than $20. In addition, the average SNAP
  recipient makes 11 purchase trips, 2-3 of them on the day of the SNAP benefit deposit.
- **SNAP benefits deplete quickly.**
  Our analysis depicts a grimmer picture than the USDA reports, as the average SNAP
  recipient spends 80% their benefits in the first nine days. By day 21, the average SNAP
  recipient has spent their entire SNAP balance.

  > AVERAGE SNAP RECIPIENT SPENDS 80% THEIR BENEFITS IN THE FIRST NINE DAYS.

  Many of these insights were shared publicly through our “Fixing the SNAP (Food Stamp) System,
  from application to spend: Learnings from the Field” webinar.

  **Experiment**
  From our behavioral diagnosis, we decided that we needed to focus on helping SNAP recipients
  smooth their consumption throughout the month. As such, we needed to directly combat the
  “windfall” eﬀect. Thus, we created a two-condition experiment. In our control condition, we showed
  SNAP recipients their monthly SNAP balance (Propel’s standard screen). In our experiment condition,
  we showed SNAP recipients a weekly budget, anchoring them to a weekly spendable amount.

  To ensure that our experiment does not have the unintended consequence of people eating lower
  quality foods for the sake of spending less, we are running weekly surveys about food consumption
  across all conditions.

  **Results**
  We launched this experiment in September, and it was in the field until January 20, 2017. Preliminary
  results indicated that we were able to help users smooth their consumption by roughly three more
  days in the experiment condition, as compared to the control condition. This resulted in nine extra
  meals for a family per month.

  Additionally, the weekly health surveys showed that there was no diﬀerence in healthiness of
  consumption between the control and the experiment conditions, contradicting concerns that
  families would trade oﬀ food quality as a result of better budgeting.

  This experiment has huge impact for the field. Propel has indicated that pending the success of this
  pilot, it will roll out a version of this intervention, utilizing the behavioral findings of this experiment,
  to its entire consumer base. To date, Propel is the largest servicer of SNAP recipients nationwide. In
  addition, we hope that policy makers see these results and try to help people budget by giving
  SNAP recipients a weekly budget, printing the budget on the EBT card, or by simply making more
  frequent distributions throughout the month.</p>
