### Opportunity

As Autodesk’s product ecosystem continued to expand, the need for a unified approach to shared workflows and feature delivery grew more important. With 60+ products across web and desktop platforms, teams needed a scalable way to offer consistent, contextually aware experiences without losing product-level flexibility. This created an opportunity to design a modular overlay framework that could deliver common functionality while respecting each product’s unique environment.

### Process & Key Findings

Through system audits, workflow analysis, and user research, I uncovered key insights:

- **Inconsistent Access Patterns**: Users had to relearn where to find common tools in every product.
- **Duplication of Effort**: Teams rebuilt similar features independently without a reusable foundation.
- **Resistance to Disruption**: Any system introduced had to respect local product nuances and workflows.
- **Opportunity for Contextual Assistance**: Users often missed features or workflows they would benefit from without better in-product guidance.

### Design & Execution

I led the design of a modular overlay system that standardized how shared functionality could be delivered across web and desktop products:

- **Build-Once, Deploy-Anywhere Architecture**: Created flexible UI modules that teams could integrate with minimal rework.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Designed interactions to adapt to the host product’s environment, avoiding disruption.
- **System Alignment**: Ensured overlay components were extensible while still enforcing a shared visual and interaction language.

In parallel, I extended the overlay framework to support intelligent, context-aware assistance:

- **Persistent Intelligent Assistant**: Developed a "pair programmer"-style system to surface relevant tools, tips, and predictive workflows inside the overlay.
- **Intent Mapping**: Mapped user behaviors and workflows to surface smart recommendations aligned with user goals.
- **Non-Intrusive Design**: Balanced proactive intelligence with unobtrusive interaction, giving users control over when and how they engaged with surfaced suggestions.

### Key Deliverables

- Cross-product overlay framework and integration patterns
- Component library for shared features and intelligent assistance
- Intelligent assistant architecture and interaction models
- Rollout strategy and enablement playbook for product teams
