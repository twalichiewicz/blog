### Opportunity

Autodesk’s 60+ product ecosystem had become fragmented, with inconsistent UI paradigms and duplicated feature development. Teams struggled to share functionality across products, and users encountered friction moving between tools.

### Process & Key Findings

Through system audits and user research, I uncovered key insights:

- **Inconsistent Access Patterns**: Users had to relearn where to find shared tools in every product.
- **Duplication of Effort**: Teams rebuilt similar features independently due to lack of reusable frameworks.
- **Resistance to Disruption**: Any new system had to respect existing product affordances.

### Design & Execution

I designed a modular overlay system that enabled consistent feature deployment across surfaces:

- **Build-Once, Deploy-Anywhere Architecture**: Widgets could be reused without reengineering for each host product.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Overlay interactions adapted gracefully to product-specific environments.
- **Design System Alignment**: Components enforced platform-wide consistency without forcing uniformity.

### Key Deliverables

- Cross-product overlay framework and scalable integration patterns
- Component library and interaction model documentation
- Rollout playbook for cross-team adoption
