subtitle: Sometimes the best ideas come from looking back
short: true
---

Found a stack of my old design notebooks tucked away in a drawer today. Pages filled with sketches, half-formed ideas, and that particular kind of energy that comes from putting pen to paper without overthinking it.

There's something about the tactile process of sketching that digital tools can't quite replicate. The weight of the pencil, the texture of paper, the way ideas flow more freely when your hand is moving. Those notebooks captured a rawness and immediacy that made me want to bring some of that spirit back to my work.

Felt inspired enough to completely redo the Works page. Sometimes you need to look back to move forward.
