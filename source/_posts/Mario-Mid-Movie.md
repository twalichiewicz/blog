[via Variety:](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/super-mario-bros-movie-1-billion-box-office-milestone-1235598832/)

> As of Sunday, after 26 days of release, the animated video game adaptation, from Universal, Illumination and Nintendo, has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationallly. It’s only the fifth movie of pandemic times to join the $1 billion club, following “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Jurassic World Dominion” and “Avatar: The Way of Water.”

It is always remarkable reading through the reviews of films like this: super mid reviews, talk of plot holes, etc., yet they still manage to draw crowds in.

This disconnect between online noise and reality has really stopped being surprising at this point. You can see the same thing happen with major yearly releases of video games (Madden, FIFA, Call of Duty), where the reviewers will point out how the game is more of the same, does nothing special, isn't worth the money, and yet those are always the top grossing games every year.
