Maybe it's coming in a future iteration of the Apple Vision Pro, but it's strange that they stuck to the app paradigm for a device that seems to suggest it'd be a great persistent head-up display assistant:

- Always knows what you're looking at, could reasonably overlay relevant information
- Speaking to Siri could automatically process whatever you're looking at
- As we've seen from some of the early demos, window-based interfaces make sense for laptops / desktops because they're stationary, that paradigm falls apart if people are moving too much (though having multiple apps placed in 3d space is an okay in-between solution)
