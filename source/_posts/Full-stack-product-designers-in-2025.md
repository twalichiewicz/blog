**Full-stack product designers:**
Strategy, UX, UI, prototyping, maybe even shipping code. The role sounds like a dream, but most teams don't know how to actually use it.

I've often been brought on because I work this way— across product strategy, cross-product systems, AI tooling, and UX design. The job is about seeing the big picture, stitching together product intent, and making sure the execution supports it end to end.

But here's what I've learned:
Full-stack doesn't mean "do everything."
It means "connect everything."

Too often, companies hire this kind of designer… then unintentionally limit their impact. They get stuck in handoff loops, vague ownership zones, or left out of key product decisions entirely.

If you're hiring for a designer who can go end-to-end, here's what actually sets them up for success:
 • Involve them early in framing the problem, not just shaping the UI
 • Give them access to context, not just tasks
 • Trust them to lead cross-functionally, not just design individually
 • Let them define what done looks like, not just what pretty looks like

When done well, this role becomes a force multiplier. Not just for speed but for clarity, alignment, and momentum. The orgs that recognize that (and build the structure to support it) will attract and retain a different caliber of designer.
