If Apple is continuing to expand their iCloud services (things like iCloud Relay, Hide My Email, etc.), I'd love to see a native Calendly competitor built into the Calendar app / service.

Feels like a pretty natural fit since all of their other services are about quality of life improvements to using the internet and connecting with people.
