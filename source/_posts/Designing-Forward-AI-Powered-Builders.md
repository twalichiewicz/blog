excerpt: "A deep dive into solving the UX bottleneck in AI builders‚Äîmoving from prompt-in, failure-out to conversational, transparent interfaces that guide users to success."
---

When I was invited to an onsite at Replit, the prompt was simple:
"How might we help users reach a successful outcome faster?"

> **TL;DR:** AI builders fail not because their models are weak, but because they don't negotiate intent. This post outlines a four-layer UX MVP‚Äîand a dual-agent North Star‚Äîto turn "prompt-in, failure-out" into conversational collaboration.

It's a deceptively hard question‚Äîespecially in the context of AI-native software creation, where the user doesn't always know what they want, the system doesn't always understand what's being asked, and failed attempts can quickly spiral into frustration.

Over the course of the day, I mapped the problem, explored root causes, and sketched out a future-facing system that combined better UX scaffolding with a foundational shift in how AI tooling communicates intent. I spent hours in their office mapping these flows in real-time on whiteboards. I took the problem seriously. I still believe it's one of the most exciting design challenges in the world.

Some of those ideas now seem to have made their way into Replit's product. But if companies are going to incorporate designer contributions into their product, they should be equally willing to recognize them. So I'm sharing the original thinking here‚Äînot just to document authorship, but because it only seems fair that OpenAI, Meta, Perplexity, Apple Intelligence, and Google DeepMind get these thoughts too. Let's invite broader conversation on how AI product design should evolve next.

## üß® The Core Problem:

**Prompt-in, failure-out.**

Most AI builders rely on a text input as the starting point. In Replit's case, users type a short description of the app they want to build, then hit "Build." But too often:
- The system misunderstands what they meant
- The output is technically broken or misaligned
- The user doesn't know why it failed or what to try next

This friction loop is worse for non-technical users, who don't have the vocabulary to retry efficiently. And when they don't succeed in the first few tries, they leave.

‚∏ª

## üîç Insight:

**The real UX bottleneck isn't the build engine‚Äîit's the mapping layer.**

AI can't deliver useful output unless it has a clear, actionable understanding of what the user wants. But today's prompt boxes are blind to ambiguity, and the system gives no feedback about confidence, feasibility, or interpretation before triggering an action.

We need to stop treating prompt input as a monologue and instead treat it like a conversation.

‚∏ª

## üß† The Design Solution: A Layered System of Interpretation & Feedback

Over the course of several hours at Replit's HQ, I sketched and iterated on a proposal to address this. My solution had four core pillars:

### 1. Inline Prompt Validation (Inspired by password strength patterns)

As users type their request, the system actively evaluates it against known buildable patterns, surfacing suggestions, clarifying questions, or warnings in real time.
- "Try adding more detail about the UI"
- "Looks like you're building a CRUD app ‚Äî which data model?"
- "Ambiguous term detected: do you mean X or Y?"

This brings clarity without interrupting flow.

### 2. Mini-Agent Co-Pilot (Always Parsing Input)

A lightweight agent runs in the background, interpreting the prompt continuously and surfacing micro-interventions. Think of it as a Product Manager in your input box, asking just-in-time questions and identifying likely blockers before they happen.

This agent could also reuse known successful prompt templates or nudge users toward proven paths.

### 3. Confidence Meter on the Build Button

Rather than a binary "Build" action, users see a dynamic signal of how confident the system is in its ability to deliver a viable result.
This reduces anxiety and adds trust. It also teaches users what the system needs to succeed.

### 4. Netflix-Style App Preview Cards

Above the prompt box, users are shown 2‚Äì3 interpretations of what the system thinks they want to build‚Äîbased on the input so far.
- A chat app with login + chatroom
- A note-taking app with tags and markdown
- A portfolio site with sections + deployment config

This turns abstract prompts into tangible outcomes, helps users course-correct, and gives the system a chance to show its understanding.

## üåÖ The North Star Vision: Dual-Agent Design

While the above solution is a pragmatic short-term MVP, I also proposed a future architecture based on parallel AI agents:
- **A Lightweight Agent** acts like a PM, constantly asking clarifying questions, managing scope, and helping users prioritize.
- **A Heavyweight Agent** acts as the builder‚Äîperforming deeper operations like scaffolding, deploying, or reconfiguring environments.

These agents would run in parallel, offering guidance and execution simultaneously. This mirrors how real product teams operate: not just building quickly, but building the right thing.

‚∏ª

## üß± Why This Matters

AI builders like Replit are uniquely positioned to democratize software creation. But if we want to truly enable anyone to build apps, we need to acknowledge that the front-end UX layer is just as important as the model underneath.

Without better interpretation tools, intent gets lost. Without transparency and guidance, users flail.
And without thoughtful design, even the most powerful models will fail to deliver on their potential.
