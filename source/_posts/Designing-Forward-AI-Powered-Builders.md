excerpt: "The real UX bottleneck isn't the model—it's the conversation."
---

When I was invited to an onsite at Replit, the design challenge was deceptively simple:
"How might we help users reach a successful outcome faster?"

That question gets at the heart of a much bigger issue: the invisible UX failures baked into today's AI-native software creation tools.
Because when users type in a prompt and hit "Build," they're not just asking a system to execute—they're entering a black box. And when that box misfires, the result isn't just a failed build. It's a loss of confidence, clarity, and momentum.

Over the course of several hours onsite, I mapped out the problem, traced it to its root causes, and proposed a layered system to close the gap between what users mean and what the system delivers. That work informed everything from UI flow to deeper architecture.

Some of those ideas have since started showing up in the product. And maybe that's coincidence—or maybe it just means this thinking is timely. Either way, I'm publishing my original solution here not just to document it, but because this problem space is far too important to solve in silos. If we want to help AI tooling reach its full potential, we need to push the conversation industry-wide. That includes teams at OpenAI, Meta, Apple, Perplexity, and DeepMind too.

## The Core Problem: Prompt-in, failure-out

Most AI builders still rely on a barebones text box as the primary interface. The user types something vague, hits enter, and hopes the system understands. But too often:

- The prompt is ambiguous
- The output is broken or misaligned
- The system offers no path to course-correct

This friction disproportionately affects non-technical users—those without the vocabulary to refine their ask or troubleshoot the result. And when success feels like guesswork, people give up.

## Insight: The failure isn't in the build engine—it's in the mapping layer.

Before an AI model can generate something useful, it needs a crisp interpretation of intent. But most prompt interfaces are one-way streets. There's no feedback, no preflight check, no signal of whether the system gets it.

That's not how people work. That's not how teams build. It's time we stopped treating AI prompts as monologues—and started designing them as conversations.

## The Proposal: A Layered UX System for Interpretation and Guidance

Here's the framework I presented during my Replit onsite—designed to shift from black-box execution to transparent, confidence-building interaction:

### 1. Inline Prompt Validation

Think password strength meters, but for buildable prompts. As users type, the system gives live feedback:

- "Try adding more detail about the UI"
- "Looks like a CRUD app—what's the data model?"
- "Ambiguous term detected: X or Y?"

The goal is clarity without disruption.

### 2. Mini-Agent Co-Pilot

A lightweight agent parses input in real time, suggesting interventions or clarifications before the user hits "Build."

Think of it like a product manager embedded in the input box—nudging scope, reusing successful templates, and reducing ambiguity proactively.

### 3. Confidence Meter on the Build Button

Instead of a blind "go" button, users see a confidence readout based on input clarity and system readiness.

This reframes the interaction from binary success/failure to informed collaboration.

### 4. Netflix-Style App Preview Cards

Above the prompt, the system shows 2–3 interpretations of what it thinks the user is asking for:

- A chat app with login + chatroom
- A note-taking app with tags + markdown
- A portfolio site with sections + deploy config

This gives users a chance to course-correct—or confirm the system's understanding—before resources are spent.

## North Star: Parallel Agents, Real Collaboration

The long-term vision builds on this with a dual-agent model:

- A Lightweight Agent manages context, asks questions, and helps users scope their goals—like a PM guiding feature development.
- A Heavyweight Agent handles the actual build, leveraging infrastructure and deeper model capabilities.

They run in parallel, mirroring real-world team dynamics: insight + execution.

## Why This Matters

AI-native creation tools are poised to reshape how we build—but only if users can succeed.

That won't happen by scaling compute alone. It will happen by designing systems that understand, clarify, and teach. Systems that treat ambiguity as a design problem—not a user error.

Because at the end of the day, the true unlock isn't faster builds.

It's better conversations.
