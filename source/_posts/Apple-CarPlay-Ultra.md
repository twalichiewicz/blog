[THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzfpbVzSBFg) is what Apple CarPlay Ultra looks like?

This looks like a rough mock you put together before you spend time polishing the visuals to match the level of craftsmanship clear in the physical design of the car. This might have been amazing back in the early 2000's when car infotainment systems were a running joke, but now this is being compared against [Rivian](https://www.thedrive.com/news/rivians-new-cel-shaded-infotainment-update-is-cool-and-mandatory), [Lucid](https://lucidowners.com/threads/some-ui-screenshots-gravity-software-v-3-07.12085/), [Volvo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GalOmedUCoo), and others.

Apple pitches Ultra as “deeply integrated and fully skinnable,” but Aston’s launch video shows the stock iOS palette pasted over six-figure craftsmanship. Meanwhile, the flat-grey HVAC sliders ignore the cabin’s knurled toggles, and the music widget’s left-to-right progress bar falls directly under a right-hand steering-wheel spoke—neither is a fatal flaw, but both scream phone app rather than GT cockpit.
