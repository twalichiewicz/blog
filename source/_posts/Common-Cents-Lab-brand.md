### Opportunity

As the inaugural designer for Common Cents Lab—a nonprofit at the forefront of advancing behavioral science research and education—I faced the unique challenge of rapidly establishing a brand identity from scratch. With no pre-existing visual framework, my task was to craft a cohesive and compelling visual language that seamlessly extended across the website, social media channels, and print materials. This foundational work was designed not only to encapsulate the organization’s mission but also to deepen the audience’s understanding of the financial challenges it seeks to address.

### Design & Execution

Working as a solo designer, I embraced the challenge of developing a brand identity that speaks directly to the essence of Common Cents Lab. My creative approach was anchored by the compelling visual metaphor of a lens—a symbol that refines focus and reveals underlying truths. Just as a high-quality lens clarifies and magnifies intricate details, the brand identity invites audiences to reframe their perspective on financial challenges, encouraging a closer examination of complex behavioral insights.

Every design decision—from the precision of the typography to the intentional color palette—was made with the lens metaphor in mind. This narrative device goes beyond mere aesthetics; it serves as an invitation to "zoom in" on the multifaceted nature of financial behavior, transforming abstract data into clear, actionable insights. By marrying the analytical rigor of behavioral science with a visually engaging identity, I created a cohesive and accessible brand system that resonates across both digital and physical mediums.
