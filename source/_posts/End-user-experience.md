## Opportunity

As Lyra began its journey in transforming mental healthcare access, the need was clear: simplify the experience for users seeking support. This project covers the end-user experience—making it effortless for users to schedule appointments with their case managers or doctors, seamlessly accept calls, and navigate sensitive topics through a positive, reassuring visual approach. The challenge was to create an interface that demystifies the process and instills clarity and empathy from the very first interaction.

## Process & Key Findings

Working closely with Lyra's leadership, I dove into competitive analysis and conducted user interviews and feedback sessions. These efforts uncovered some crucial insights:

- **Accessibility & Privacy:** Users demanded discreet, on-demand support that assured them of complete privacy.
- **Streamlined Onboarding:** Feedback pointed to the frustration of finding the right provider, underlining the need for a seamless, guided onboarding experience.
- **Emotional Tone:** The design had to balance warmth and professionalism, ensuring that the platform felt both inviting and trustworthy.

## Design & Execution

Guided by these insights and early leadership input, I developed a prototype focused exclusively on the end-user experience. The design was crafted to simplify interactions and foster a supportive, reassuring atmosphere. Key elements included:

- **Streamlined Scheduling & Communication:** I created an intuitive flow that made it effortless for users to schedule meetings with their case managers or doctors, and to accept calls seamlessly—ensuring timely and stress-free interactions.
- **Positive Visual Approach:** Recognizing that mental health topics can be distressing, I employed a calming visual language with soft color palettes and thoughtful typography to help maintain a positive, reassuring ambiance.
- **User-Centered Interactions:** Every element was designed with the user in mind, from clear call-to-action buttons to logical navigation, making it easy for users to access the care they need when they need it.

## Key Deliverables

- **High-Fidelity Wireframes & Interactive Prototypes:** Detailed deliverables that mapped the complete user journey, from initial sign-up to accessing mental health resources. These prototypes were essential for usability testing and stakeholder alignment.
- **Responsive Design Implementation:** Ensured that every aspect of the user interface delivered a consistent and intuitive experience across all devices.
- **End-to-End User Flow Documentation:** Comprehensive flow maps outlining every user touchpoint—from streamlined onboarding to appointment scheduling and content exploration.

## Outcomes

- **Positive Qualitative Feedback:** Usability testing and stakeholder reviews underscored the intuitive layout and clear design approach.
- **Validation of the Approach:** Early prototype evaluations confirmed that the streamlined onboarding and calming visual language were effective in addressing user needs.
- **Foundation for Future Enhancements:** The design set a robust basis for future iterations, paving the way for additional features like personalized care plans and expanded support channels.
