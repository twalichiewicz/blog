### Opportunity

In 2014, Miti Health (now Maisha Meds) provided an Android-based mobile pharmacy software for rural Kenyan pharmacies. However, the digital interface didn’t reflect the everyday realities of these users—who worked at desks with paper records. The challenge was to redesign the experience so it felt natural and intuitive, echoing the familiar, paper-based workflow of the pharmacies.

### Process & Key Findings

I began with a comprehensive UX audit and reviewed photos that documented how pharmacists worked on the ground. This research revealed several key insights:

- **Workflow Alignment:** Pharmacists were accustomed to handling paper and organizing information at a desk. The existing interface felt too detached from this reality.
- **Usability Gaps:** The digital experience needed to be more intuitive, reducing friction and mirroring the logical flow of their daily tasks.
- **Contextual Relevance:** A design that resonated with the physical environment—its tactile and organized nature—was essential to drive adoption.

### Design & Execution

Guided by these insights, I reimagined the interface to bridge the gap between digital and physical workflows:

- **Contextual Interface Design:** I crafted a design that mirrored the structure and feel of a paper-based system, making it easier for users to adapt to the digital environment.
- **Simplified Navigation:** The new layout streamlined key tasks like inventory management and record-keeping, closely aligning with the natural flow of working at a desk.
- **Familiar Visual Cues:** By incorporating design elements reminiscent of traditional paper forms and organized desks, the interface felt like a logical extension of their current processes.

### Key Deliverables

- **High-Fidelity Wireframes & Interactive Prototypes:** Detailed designs that mapped out the reimagined user journey on Android, ensuring alignment with real-world workflows.
- **End-to-End User Flow Documentation:** Clear, structured flow maps that reflected the natural progression of tasks in a busy pharmacy setting.
- **Visual Design Assets:** A refined set of UI components that captured the tactile feel of paper-based systems while leveraging the efficiency of digital interactions.

### Outcomes

Feedback from the field was encouraging. Pharmacy staff noted that the redesigned interface felt familiar and intuitive—making it easier to transition from traditional methods to a digital solution. This project laid a strong foundation for more user-centric innovations in rural healthcare, ensuring that technology truly served the way people worked.
