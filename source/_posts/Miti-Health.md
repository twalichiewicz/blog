summary:
  problem:
    content: "Rural Kenyan pharmacies relied on Android-based software that felt disconnected from their paper-based workflows. Pharmacists worked at desks with familiar paper records, but the digital interface didn't reflect these everyday realities. The existing system created friction and resistance to adoption because it failed to mirror the logical flow of their daily tasks."
  solution:
    content: "I redesigned the interface to bridge the gap between digital and physical workflows by creating a system that mirrored the structure and feel of paper-based operations. The new design made the digital environment feel like a logical extension of their current desk-based processes."

## Research & Cultural Understanding

Working with Miti Health (now Maisha Meds) in 2014 required deep understanding of how rural Kenyan pharmacies actually operated. Through photo documentation and field research, I discovered that pharmacists had developed sophisticated paper-based systems that worked efficiently within their environment.

The key insight was that these weren't outdated methods—they were optimized workflows that had evolved to meet specific needs. Any digital solution needed to respect and enhance these existing patterns rather than forcing completely new behaviors.

## Design Process & Implementation

I conducted a comprehensive UX audit while reviewing extensive photo documentation of pharmacists at work. This research revealed the importance of desk-based organization and the tactile nature of their information management systems.

The design process focused on translating rather than replacing these workflows. Instead of asking pharmacists to learn new digital paradigms, I created interfaces that felt like natural extensions of their paper-based expertise.

## User Experience Innovation

The breakthrough was understanding that digital adoption in this context wasn't about modernization—it was about enhancement. The interface needed to feel familiar while providing the advantages of digital systems: backup, searching, reporting, and connectivity.

By incorporating visual elements reminiscent of traditional forms and maintaining the logical structure of desk-based workflows, the digital system became a tool that amplified existing expertise rather than replacing it.

## Impact & Validation

Field feedback confirmed the approach's effectiveness. Pharmacists described the redesigned interface as intuitive and familiar, validating the strategy of building bridges between physical and digital workflows rather than creating entirely new patterns.

This project demonstrated that successful technology adoption in traditional environments requires respect for existing expertise and careful translation of proven workflows into digital advantages.
