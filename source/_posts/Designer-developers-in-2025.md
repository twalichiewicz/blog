Designers who can't code are getting left behind. I've been leveraging generative tools to rapidly prototype and ship finished components—cutting my implementation time in half while maintaining complete creative control.
Why this matters: Understanding how your designs translate to code makes you a better designer. Period. You spot technical constraints earlier, make smarter decisions about interactions, and speak the language developers respect.

The most valuable designers in 2025 aren't just creating static mockups—they're building functional prototypes that demonstrate real behavior and can evolve into production code.

Stop outsourcing your technical understanding. Start utilizing technology to execute your vision directly and precisely.
