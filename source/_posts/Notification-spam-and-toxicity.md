Notification toxicity is always a clear sign of non-designers trying to eke out some congratulatory metrics at the cost of brand perception and user experience.

The example that always comes to mind are DoorDash notifications. You _would_ want to leave them on for what you can consider useful information (order status, delivery driver messages), but by doing so you get uninvited marketing spam piped directly to you.
