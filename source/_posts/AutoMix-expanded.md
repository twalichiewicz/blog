[Now that we have AutoMix](#post-iOS-26-AutoMix), can I have it trigger when I hit the "Next" button? 

Don't punish me with an abrupt stop/start between songs, queue up the next song in the background and then immediately start blending into the next song. If you still want to retain the current functionality just make a double-tap of the Next button expedite the transition to the next song (maybe even throw in a recordscratch sound for good measure).
