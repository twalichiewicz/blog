Is it so much to ask that music players finally get the ability to dynamically transition between songs? No more abrupt stop/start between songs. Have a mini LLM generate a transition using the stems of the songs

The functionality coud work as a dip-in-dip out-- if you stop adding tracks to the Play Next queue, a station is dynamically formed, and then you as the user can take back over if it veers off or you have a specific one-off you want to listen to.
