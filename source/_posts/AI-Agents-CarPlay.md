AI agents should function like CarPlay – a consistent experience that follows you everywhere, adapting to your context.

Imagine if your personal preferences, history, and working style moved with you across every device and application:

- In Figma, it automatically applies your preferred spacing, color patterns, and component structures based on your past designs
- When you switch to Google Docs, it adjusts your writing to match previous tone and style while suggesting content based on related projects
- During a Zoom call, it retrieves relevant materials from past meetings without you having to search
- In Xcode, it suggests code patterns matching your typical architectural approaches while flagging potential issues based on your historical bugs

Think of it as a dual-screen setup where your AI device acts as that second screen – offering insights, suggestions, and corrections based on your established patterns while adapting to your current context.

This isn't just about assistant features – it's about creating true digital continuity:

1. Your design preferences automatically apply in any creative tool
2. Your writing style and communication patterns follow you into any document
3. Your organizational systems adapt to whatever information environment you're in

The breakthrough comes when you no longer need to maintain separate workflows and preferences for each application. Your digital environment shapes itself around you, rather than you adapting to each environment.

Could this be the next evolution of personal computing – environments that truly know and adapt to us, rather than the other way around?
