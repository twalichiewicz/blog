## Overview

Detour is a lightweight Chrome extension that intercepts impulse clicks. Instead of opening a new tab right away, it saves the link to a tidy, time-boxed queue so you stay on task.

## How it works

- **One-click queue:** Send any link to Detour with a single click or shortcut.
- **Time-boxed sessions:** Open your queued links in focused batches when you’re ready.
- **Minimal footprint:** Tiny, privacy-friendly, and designed for speed—no accounts required.

## Why use it

- Keep deep work intact by avoiding rabbit holes.
- Batch reading into intentional sessions.
- Reduce tab sprawl and context switching.
