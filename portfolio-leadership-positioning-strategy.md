## üö® IMMEDIATE WIN: Stats Section Reframe (2-3 hours)

### Current Problem:
Stats show coordination but not INFLUENCE SCALE or PROCESS INNOVATION

### Leadership Stats Strategy:
**Focus on influence scale, process creation, and strategic partnership**

#### **Enhanced Leadership Examples:**
- **"Process Innovation: Design Critique Framework"** (methodology creation)
- **"Cross-Team Influence: 6 Product Teams Aligned"** (influence without authority)
- **"Strategic Partnership: Quarterly Business Reviews"** (executive engagement)
- **"Peer Recognition: 3 Internal Innovation Awards"** (leadership through expertise)
- **"Knowledge Transfer: Estimation & Methodology Adoption"** (scaling impact)
- **"Technical Leadership: Code Contributor + Design Systems"** (full-stack design)

#### **Cross-Functional Partnership Examples:**
- **"Engineering Educator: Design Methodology Workshops"**
- **"Strategic Contributor: Product Planning Partner"**
- **"Process Innovator: Team Productivity Systems"**
- **"Quality Driver: Design Review Standards"**

## üî• PROJECT STATS CONSISTENCY UPDATES

### Stats Structure (Keep Current Format):
1. **Problem/Solution Row** - Business context
2. **Team/Timeline/Platform Row** - Project details  
3. **Leadership Row** - Influence, process innovation, strategic partnership
4. **Skills Row** - Technical and domain expertise

### Updated Leadership Content Focus:
- **Influence Scale:** How many teams/people affected by your processes
- **Strategic Input:** QDR presentations, business planning partnership
- **Process Innovation:** Methodologies you created that teams adopted
- **Cross-Functional Education:** Teaching design to eng/PM
- **Technical Leadership:** Code contribution, architecture decisions
- **Awards/Recognition:** Internal peer recognition for innovation

## üìù Key Experience Highlights from Thomas:

### Process Innovation Leadership:
- Design critique systems that improved team cohesiveness
- Estimation methodologies adopted across teams
- Workshop facilitation and design education
- QDR presentation development and strategic input

### Cross-Functional Influence:
- Embedded in eng/PM decisions (not request-fulfillment)
- Teaching design methodology to engineers
- Strategic partnership in product planning
- Technical contribution while maintaining design excellence

### Peer Recognition:
- Multiple internal innovation/teamwork awards at Autodesk
- Process adoption across teams
- Mentorship of junior designers while staying hands-on
- Consistent strategic influence without formal authority

## üéØ Value Proposition Reframe:

**"Principal Designer who drives organizational change through process innovation, cross-functional partnership, and technical leadership - scaling design impact beyond individual contributions while maintaining hands-on excellence."**

### Key Differentiators:
1. **Influence Leadership:** Drives change without requiring management hierarchy
2. **Process Innovation:** Creates methodologies that scale beyond personal work
3. **Strategic Partnership:** Embedded in business decisions, not just execution
4. **Technical Depth:** Code contributor + design systems architecture
5. **Cross-Functional Educator:** Teaches design thinking to non-designers
6. **Peer Recognition:** Consistent internal awards for innovation and teamwork

The positioning shift: From "trying to look like a manager" to "demonstrating senior IC leadership excellence" - which is exactly what $220-280k principal/staff designer roles require.
