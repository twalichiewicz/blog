# Self-Service Publishing Pipeline Demo Flow

## Overview
This demo showcases the LINO (Content Authoring Tool) interface that transformed Autodesk's content publishing from a 3-4 week engineering process to same-day self-service.

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Three-Column Workflow
The interface uses a clear three-column layout that guides content creators through the publishing process:
- **When the user of...** (Behavioral Targeting)
- **Then send them...** (Content Creation)
- **And use these delivery instructions...** (Distribution Rules)

### 2. Visual Behavioral Targeting
- Product selection dropdown
- Wiki URL validation for trigger documentation
- Natural language notes for complex logic

### 3. WYSIWYG Content Editor
- Live preview of how content appears in-product
- Drag-and-drop media upload
- Button and CTA configuration
- Feedback mechanism integration

### 4. Smart Distribution Controls
- Version targeting (specific versions or ranges)
- Platform selection (In-product, App Home, Email)
- User segment targeting
- Immediate or scheduled circulation

## Interactive Elements

### Form Validation
- Real-time URL validation with visual feedback
- Smart defaults that can be customized
- Progressive disclosure of advanced options

### Expanded Options
- Click "Edit" links to reveal advanced targeting options
- Version range selection with dropdowns
- Multi-platform distribution checkboxes

### Navigation
- Sidebar icons for different tool sections:
  - Create (Lightbulb) - Main content creation
  - Library (FileText) - Saved templates
  - Connections (Link2) - Integrations
  - Analytics (BarChart2) - Performance metrics

## User Journey

1. **Content Identification**: User names their insight
2. **Trigger Definition**: Specify when content should appear
3. **Content Creation**: Build the actual guidance/tip
4. **Distribution Rules**: Set who sees it and when
5. **Review & Publish**: One-click submission

## Business Impact Highlights
- Reduced publishing time from 3-4 weeks to 2 hours
- Enabled non-technical teams to publish content
- Unlocked $6-8M in revenue opportunities
- Saved $2M annually in engineering costs

## Technical Innovation
- Drag-and-drop behavioral targeting replaces complex code queries
- Form submission triggers entire technical pipeline automatically
- Built-in safety features (spell check, link validation, rollback)
- Collaborative review workflow with inline feedback
