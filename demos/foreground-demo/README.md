# Foreground Design System Demo

Interactive demonstration of the Foreground design system created for Human Interest, showcasing how a single design system served three distinct user personas with different complexity needs.

## Demo Features

### üé≠ Persona Switching
Experience the design system from three different user perspectives:

- **Employee**: Simple, approachable interface for retirement planning
- **Administrator**: Balanced density for compliance management  
- **Operations**: Bloomberg Terminal-style efficiency for multi-client oversight

### üìù Fauxdal Pattern Demo
Interactive walkthrough of the innovative "fauxdal" pattern:
- Full-screen modal interface
- Progressive disclosure of complex 401(k) paperwork
- Step-by-step validation and guidance
- Completion flow demonstration

### üß© Component Library
Browse the adaptive component system:
- Visual foundation (colors, typography, spacing)
- Core UI components with persona-specific styling
- Form controls and data visualization elements
- Interactive state demonstrations

### üìä Impact Metrics
Real business outcomes achieved:
- 90% reduction in UI confusion support calls
- Engineering implementation time: 50% ‚Üí 10%
- External recognition by Brand New - Under Consideration

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **React 18** with hooks for state management
- **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions between personas
- **React Hook Form** for fauxdal enrollment flow
- **Recharts** for data visualization components
- **DemoWrapper** for consistent portfolio presentation

### Persona System
The demo dynamically applies different styling and complexity levels:

```javascript
const personas = {
  employee: {
    density: 'comfortable',
    complexity: 'basic'
  },
  admin: {
    density: 'standard', 
    complexity: 'intermediate'
  },
  operations: {
    density: 'compact',
    complexity: 'advanced'
  }
}
```

### Key Components
- `PersonaSwitcher`: Toggle between user types
- `FauxdalEnrollment`: Interactive paperwork flow
- `ComponentLibrary`: Adaptive UI component showcase
- `DesignSystemOverview`: Foundation and principles

## User Journey
