## Common Patterns Identified:

1. **Role**: Most projects show Thomas as Lead Designer or UX Lead
2. **Timeline**: Projects span from 2014-2025, with concentration in 2016-2020
3. **Team Size**: Typically cross-functional teams with Engineering, PM, and domain experts
4. **Platform**: Mix of web applications, desktop software, and mobile apps
5. **Impact**: Strong focus on measurable business outcomes (cost savings, efficiency gains)
6. **Skills**: Emphasis on research, prototyping, visual design, and systems thinking

## Recommendations:

1. Standardize the format across all projects for consistency
2. Include timeline/duration for all projects
3. Add team size/composition where relevant
4. Highlight specific technologies/tools used
5. Quantify impact with metrics where possible
6. Consider adding a "Challenge" field to complement the impact
