Largest Single File: _project.scss (1,930 lines)
Most !important in File: _layout-fixes.scss (45)
```

## Target State Goals

### File Metrics Goals
```yaml
Total SCSS Files: ~15 (-65%)
Total Lines of SCSS: ~2,500 (-70%)
Compiled CSS Size: ~115KB (-60%)
!important Usage: 0 (-100%)
Media Query Approaches: 1 consistent method
Dark Mode Lines: 0 (handled by color system)
```

### Architecture Goals
```yaml
Typography System: 1 unified utility system
Component Library: 10 reusable base components
Design Tokens: 1 single source of truth
CSS Custom Properties: 50+ variables

## Measurement Scripts

### Count !important usage
```bash
# Run from styles directory
grep -r "!important" . | wc -l

# Per file breakdown
grep -c "!important" *.scss | sort -t: -k2 -nr
```

### Measure file sizes
```bash
# SCSS line count
find . -name "*.scss" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -nr

# Compiled CSS size
ls -lh ../../public/css/styles.css
```

### Analyze nesting depth
```bash
# Find deep nesting (5+ levels)
grep -E "^\s{20,}" *.scss
```

### Track dark mode overrides
```bash
# Count dark mode media queries
grep -r "prefers-color-scheme: dark" . | wc -l

# Count dark mode data attributes
grep -r 'data-theme="dark"' . | wc -l
```

## Quality Metrics

### Before Refactoring
```yaml
Lighthouse Performance Score: 87
First Contentful Paint: 1.2s
Total Blocking Time: 120ms
CSS Parse Time: 45ms
```

### Target After Refactoring
```yaml
Lighthouse Performance Score: 95+
First Contentful Paint: <1.0s
Total Blocking Time: <100ms
CSS Parse Time: <20ms
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Files (Handle with extra care)
1. **_layout-fixes.scss** - Most !important overrides
2. **_blog.scss** - Complex dark mode logic
3. **_project.scss** - Largest file, heavy nesting
4. **_responsive-layouts.scss** - Cross-component dependencies

### Low Risk Files (Safe to refactor early)
1. **_typography.scss** - Isolated styles
2. **_buttons.scss** - Clear component boundaries  
3. **_images.scss** - Simple utilities
4. **_code-highlighting.scss** - Third-party styles

## Success Validation

### Visual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Homepage renders identically
- [ ] Blog list maintains layout
- [ ] Post content displays correctly
- [ ] Dark mode transitions smoothly
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior preserved
- [ ] Interactive elements work properly
- [ ] Animations/transitions unchanged

### Performance Testing Checklist
- [ ] CSS file size reduced by 60%
- [ ] Page load time improved
- [ ] No layout shift issues
- [ ] Smooth scrolling maintained
- [ ] No JavaScript errors
- [ ] Build time faster

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] Zero !important flags
- [ ] No nesting beyond 3 levels
- [ ] All colors use CSS variables
- [ ] All spacing uses scale
- [ ] Media queries consistent
- [ ] Dark mode automatic

## Rollback Triggers

Stop and reassess if:
- Visual regression in >5% of pages
- Performance degradation >10%
- Build time increases >20%
- Team productivity impacted
- Critical bugs in production
