# Project Summary Component

The Project Summary component is a reusable tabbed interface that displays project information in a structured format. It replaces the old approach of parsing content headers and provides better maintainability and flexibility.

## Features

- **Structured Data**: Summary content is defined in the front matter as structured YAML data
- **Reusable**: Works consistently across all project types
- **Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA support
- **Responsive**: Optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing posts continue to work with the old parsing method

## Usage

### Basic Structure

Add a `summary` object to your post's front matter with the following sections:

```yaml
summary:
  problem:
    content: "Description of the problem you solved..."
  solution:
    content: "Description of your solution..."
  innovation:
    title: "Custom Innovation Title (optional)"
    content: "Main description of the innovation..."
    bullets:
      - "Key feature or benefit"
      - "Another key feature"
  impact:
    bullets:
      - "Measurable result"
      - "Business impact"
```

### Section Options

Each section (`problem`, `solution`, `innovation`, `impact`) can include:

- `title` (optional): Custom title for the section
- `content` (optional): Main descriptive text (supports HTML)
- `bullets` (optional): Array of bullet points (supports HTML)

### Complete Example

```yaml
---
title: My Project
company: Company Name
layout: project_gallery
tags: [portfolio]
summary:
  problem:
    content: "Users struggled with complex deployment processes that required manual configuration across multiple systems."
  solution:
    content: "I designed a unified platform that automates deployment through simple configuration files."
  innovation:
    title: "Automated Configuration System"
    content: "The key breakthrough was using XML-driven UI generation."
    bullets:
      - "<strong>Dynamic UI:</strong> Interfaces generated automatically from configuration"
      - "<strong>Multi-system Support:</strong> Single platform handles all deployment types"
      - "<strong>Zero Maintenance:</strong> Updates happen automatically"
  impact:
    bullets:
      - "Reduced deployment time from hours to minutes"
      - "Eliminated 60+ separate maintenance efforts"
      - "Saved millions in development costs"

The rest of your content will appear after the summary tabs, allowing you to provide detailed explanations, research insights, design process, etc.
```

## Migration Guide

### Converting Existing Posts

1. **Identify Summary Sections**: Look for posts with "## The Problem", "## The Solution", "## Key Innovation", and "## Impact" headers

2. **Extract Content**: Copy the content from these sections

3. **Add Summary Object**: Create the summary object in front matter with the extracted content

4. **Remove Old Headers**: Delete the old header sections (or keep them for the detailed writeup)

5. **Test**: Verify the tabs render correctly

### Example Migration

**Before:**

```markdown
---
title: My Project
---

## The Problem
Users had difficulty with complex processes.

## The Solution  
I created a simplified interface.

## Impact
- Improved user satisfaction
- Reduced support tickets
```

**After:**

```yaml
---
title: My Project
summary:
  problem:
    content: "Users had difficulty with complex processes."
  solution:
    content: "I created a simplified interface."
  impact:
    bullets:
      - "Improved user satisfaction"
      - "Reduced support tickets"

## Benefits

1. **Better Maintainability**: Summary data is structured and easy to modify
2. **Consistent Rendering**: No more regex parsing edge cases
3. **Flexible Content**: Mix paragraphs and bullet points as needed
4. **SEO Friendly**: Content is properly structured in HTML
5. **Version Control**: Changes are easier to track in structured YAML
6. **Reusable**: The same component can be used across different project types

## Backward Compatibility

Posts without a `summary` object will continue to use the original parsing method that looks for:

- "## The Problem"
- "## The Solution"
- "## Key Innovation" (with any subtitle)
- "## Impact"

This ensures existing content continues to work while new posts can adopt the improved structure.

## Styling

The component uses the same visual design as the original project tabs:

- Retro-styled button interface with LED indicators
- Smooth transitions between tabs
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Dark/light theme support

## JavaScript API

The component is automatically initialized on page load. For dynamic content:

```javascript
// Initialize summary tabs in a specific container
initializeProjectSummary(document.querySelector('.my-container'));

// Global initialization (default behavior)
window.initializeProjectSummary();
```
