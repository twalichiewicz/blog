# Visual Change Summary: Button Styling Standardization

## What changed:
- **Components**: Posts only button, View impact report button, Get in touch button
- **Properties modified**: 
  - Font-size: Changed to 12px (unified)
  - Padding: 8px 16px (unified)
  - Hover states: Enhanced with better contrast and lift effect
  - Text: "View Impact report" â†’ "View impact report"

## Why:
- User requested consistent button styling across all buttons
- Previous state had mismatched font sizes and hover effects
- Capitalization inconsistency in "Impact" needed correction

## Classification: ðŸ”´ RED LIGHT (Designer review required)
- Typography changes (font-size)
- Visual hover state modifications
- Multiple component modifications

- Homepage mobile buttons (View impact report, Get in touch)
- Blog section filter (Posts only button)

## Self-Review Checklist:
- [x] Maintains design consistency across buttons
- [x] Spacing/sizing changes are proportional (all 8px 16px)
- [x] Interactive states look correct (hover adds lift + shadow)
- [x] Text remains readable at 12px
- [x] Touch targets adequate (min height with padding exceeds 44px)

## Testing performed:
- [x] Built without errors
- [x] Tested hover states in development
- [x] Verified both light and dark mode appearance
- [x] Checked mobile responsive behavior
- [x] No console errors

## Questions for Designer:
1. Is 12px the correct font-size for these buttons? (It matches the original "Posts only" button)
2. Are the hover states (subtle lift + shadow) appropriate for the design system?
3. Should the component library default button variant use link colors on hover, or stay neutral?
