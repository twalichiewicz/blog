# Article Editing Playbook: From Draft to Publication

Based on the "How creative mediums find their voice" editing process, here's a streamlined playbook to collapse article turnaround from many rounds to 2-3 focused sessions.

## The Core Problem We Solved
- Started with: Academic-style draft with unclear positioning
- Ended with: Punchy thought leadership piece with clear forward-looking stance
- Total edits: 50+ micro-revisions that could have been 5 strategic passes

## Optimal Two-Stage Process

### Stage 1: Strategic Structure (First Pass)
**What to provide upfront:**
- Working title + core thesis
- Target word count (e.g., 1,000 words = 5-min read)
- Key stats/reports you want to integrate
- Personal anecdotes/examples (bullet points fine)
- Positioning goal (e.g., "thought leader, not late adopter")

**What you'll get back:**
- Clear narrative arc with phases/sections
- Integrated stats with proper citations
- Personal voice woven throughout
- Strong hook and CTA

### Stage 2: Precision Polish (Final Pass)
**What to flag:**
- Specific lines that feel off-tone
- Missing evidence/examples
- Positioning concerns
- Word count targets

**What you'll get back:**
- Surgical line edits
- Tightened prose
- Consistent voice
- Publication-ready copy

## Key Patterns from This Edit

### 1. Positioning Fixes (Avoid Multiple Rounds)
**Instead of:** 20+ edits to fix "late adopter" language
**Do this:** Flag positioning upfront ("I want to sound ahead-of-curve, not catching up")

**Examples from this edit:**
- "I was scrolling LinkedIn" → "As LinkedIn's AI hacks flooded my feed"
- "I've heard through grapevine" → "PrivacyPilot cleared a policy in 24 hours"
- "I tried coding" → "I deliberately switched from Swift to Rust"

### 2. Statistical Integration
**Instead of:** Adding stats piecemeal with citation confusion
**Do this:** Provide all reports/stats upfront with clear sources

**What we learned:**
- Figma 2024 survey vs Figma 2025 report vs Foundation Capital report confusion
- Multiple rounds to fix citation formatting
- Could have been one pass with clear source list

### 3. Personal Voice Integration
**Instead of:** Grafting anecdotes onto academic prose
**Do this:** Provide personal examples early, even as bullet points

**Your anecdotes that transformed the piece:**
- Film background → creative medium expertise
- Barber story → AI capability realization  
- Swift/Rust coding → concrete Phase 3 experience
- Solo founder aspiration → stakes and urgency

### 4. Structural Clarity
**Instead of:** Moving sections around multiple times
**Do this:** Lock structure first with clear phase/progression

**Final structure that worked:**
1. Hook: LinkedIn pattern recognition
2. Historical parallel: Photography → Cinema → Web → AI
3. Four phases framework
4. Current state: Stats showing Phase 1→2 shift
5. Personal transformation: Your Phase 3/4 experience
6. Future vision: Where this is headed
7. CTA: Where are you on the curve?

## Reusable Elements to Track

### Style Preferences (Set Once)
- **Dash style:** Em dashes for asides, no spaces
- **Stats format:** Span containers with data-value attributes
- **Citation style:** Superscript numbers with reference section
- **Voice:** Direct, punchy, forward-looking
- **Sentence variety:** Mix short declarations with longer explanations

### Common Fixes to Auto-Check
1. **Passive voice:** "was discovered" → "discovered"
2. **Hedging language:** "might be" → "is"
3. **Redundant phrases:** "in order to" → "to"
4. **Late adopter signals:** "realized," "discovered," "tried"
5. **Word repetition:** Multiple uses of "pace," "real," "pattern"

### Stats Formatting Template
```html
<span class="stat-container">
  <span class="stat-number" data-value="72">72%</span> 
  of teams said AI played only a minor role
</span><sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>
```

## Time-Saving Tactics

### 1. Batch Similar Edits
**Instead of:** Fixing citations one by one
**Do together:** All citation formatting, all stat integration, all voice adjustments

### 2. Flag Don't Fix
**You mark:** "This sounds reactive" or "Cut 150 words here"
**I handle:** The actual rewrites

### 3. Principle Over Prescription
**Instead of:** Line-by-line rewrites
**Give me:** "Make this sound more like Paul Graham"

### 4. Test Positioning Early
**First paragraph = positioning test**
If the opening paragraph positions you correctly, the rest follows

## Pre-Publication Checklist
- [ ] Word count on target (±50 words)
- [ ] All stats cited with working links
- [ ] No duplicate key words within paragraphs
- [ ] Clear phase/progression throughout
- [ ] Personal examples integrated naturally
- [ ] CTA simple and actionable
- [ ] Voice consistent with positioning goal

## For Next Time

**Ideal Brief Structure:**
```
Title: [Working title]
Thesis: [One sentence main argument]
Word count: [Target]
Audience: [LinkedIn thought leaders, technical blog readers, etc.]

Key points:
- [Bullet 1]
- [Bullet 2]
- [Bullet 3]

Stats/Sources:
- [Report name + link]
- [Key stat you want to use]

Personal examples:
- [Anecdote 1]
- [Anecdote 2]

Positioning: [How you want to come across]
CTA: [What you want readers to do]
```

## Result
With this playbook, this article would have taken:
- 30 min: Structure and positioning agreement
- 2 hours: Full draft with integrated elements
- 30 min: Final polish pass
- **Total: 3 hours vs 3+ days**

The key is front-loading decisions instead of discovering preferences through iteration.
