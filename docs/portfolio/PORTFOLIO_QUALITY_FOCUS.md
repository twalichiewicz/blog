# Portfolio Quality Focus: Enhancing Existing Case Studies

*Prioritizing depth over breadth - June 2025*

## Strategic Approach

Rather than documenting all 25 projects superficially, focus on making the 8 existing case studies exceptional. These projects represent your best thinking and should be polished to senior leadership standards.

## Key Principle

> "I'd rather see 3 exceptional case studies than 10 mediocre ones. Show me your best thinking, your process, and your impact. Make me want to work with you." 
> - Senior Design Director at Apple

Focus on making your best work truly exceptional. Remove everything that doesn't meet that standard.
