# Portfolio Project Analysis - June 2025

*Assessment based on senior design leadership criteria from Apple*

## Executive Summary

Current portfolio contains 25 projects but only 8 (32%) have case studies. This severely limits the portfolio's effectiveness in demonstrating senior design capabilities and impact.

**Overall Grade: C-** (Would likely fail most senior design portfolio reviews)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Shows early stage product work
- ✅ Comprehensive feature set

**Weaknesses:**
- 🚩 Minimal documentation
- 🚩 No user research shown
- 🚩 Process invisible
- 🚩 Outcomes not mentioned

**Recommendation:** Document the product development story

---

### 🔴 Weak/Missing Projects (F Grade)

#### 9-25. **Projects Without Case Studies**

**All Common Cents Lab Projects (10 projects):**
- EarnUp, PayActiv, Kiva, Digit, RetireMap, GreenPath, Plaid Integration, Self-Help CU, Research Report, CCL Brand

**All Lyra Health Projects (3 projects):**
- End User Experience, Employer Convincing Tool, Case Manager App

**Other Projects:**
- Human Interest Brand (2017)

**Critical Issues:**
- 🚩 No documentation whatsoever
- 🚩 No context for the work
- 🚩 No demonstration of design thinking
- 🚩 No outcomes or impact shown
- 🚩 Essentially invisible in portfolio

**Recommendation:** Either write case studies or remove from portfolio

## Overall Portfolio Issues

### 🚩 Red Flags (Critical)

1. **68% of projects are undocumented** - This is unacceptable for a senior designer
2. **Zero mobile/responsive discussion** - Major oversight in 2025
3. **No consistent structure** - Each case study follows different format
4. **Process invisible** - No sketches, wireframes, or iterations shown
5. **Team contributions unclear** - "I did everything" syndrome in several projects

### ❌ Missing Elements

1. **User Research** - Almost no projects show research process
2. **Design Iterations** - No evolution of thinking demonstrated
3. **Failure Stories** - No discussion of what didn't work
4. **Technical Constraints** - Limited discussion of tradeoffs
5. **Business Impact** - Most projects lack business metrics

### 🟢 Strengths

1. **Variety of work** - Shows range from enterprise to consumer
2. **Some strong outcomes** - When included, metrics are compelling
3. **Technical understanding** - Several projects show systems thinking
4. **Visual quality** - Generally clean and professional when shown

## Recommendations for Portfolio Improvement

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Write 3 case studies** for Common Cents Lab projects
2. **Add mobile sections** to all existing case studies  
3. **Clarify your role** in every project
4. **Add captions** to all images
5. **Include metrics** for every project (even estimates)

### Short Term (Next Month)

1. **Create case study template** with consistent structure
2. **Document design process** with sketches and iterations
3. **Add "Lessons Learned"** section to each project
4. **Remove or combine** weak projects without documentation
5. **Create project summary page** with all metrics/outcomes

### Long Term (Next Quarter)

1. **Reduce to 8-10 strong projects** maximum
2. **Create video walkthroughs** for complex interactions
3. **Add testimonials** from stakeholders
4. **Build interactive prototypes** for key projects
5. **Write thoughtful reflection** on design philosophy

## Competitive Benchmarking

Compared to typical senior designer portfolios at Apple/Google/Meta level:

- **Your portfolio**: 32% documented, no mobile, inconsistent
- **Expected standard**: 100% documented, mobile-first, cohesive narrative
- **Gap to close**: Significant - needs 3-6 months of focused work

---

## Final Assessment

The portfolio has strong individual elements but fails to meet the standard expected of a very senior designer. The biggest issue is that 68% of your work is essentially invisible. Even strong projects like Desktop Install Platform would benefit from deeper process documentation and mobile considerations.

**Current state**: Would not pass portfolio review at most senior positions
**Potential**: With focused effort, could be exceptional given the range and quality of work

The foundation is there - you have compelling work with real impact. But the presentation needs significant improvement to match your seniority and communicate your full value as a designer.
