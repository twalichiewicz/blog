# Portfolio Improvement Action Plan

*Based on Portfolio Analysis - June 2025*

## Priority Matrix

### üî• Week 1: Critical Fixes (Stop the Bleeding)

#### 1. Add Role Clarity to All Existing Case Studies
**Projects needing role clarification:**
- Self-Service Hub Provisioning ‚Üí "Lead Product Designer, Platform Team"
- Propel ‚Üí "Solo Designer & Developer"
- Onboarding Tool ‚Üí "Senior Product Designer (1 of 2 designers)"
- Distribution Automation ‚Üí Specify your actual role

**Template for role description:**
```
Role: [Title]
Team: [Size and composition]
My contributions: [Specific responsibilities]
Collaboration: [Who you worked with]
```

#### 2. Emergency Mobile Documentation
Add a "Responsive Design" section to these projects immediately:
- Desktop Install Platform (it's a web app!)
- Self-Service Hub Provisioning
- Onboarding Tool
- Foreground Design System

**Quick template:**
```
### Responsive Approach
- Mobile-first design process
- Breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- [Add screenshots of mobile/tablet views]
- Key mobile considerations: [touch targets, navigation patterns, etc.]
```

#### 3. Add Missing Metrics
**Projects with no metrics (add even if estimated):**
- Propel ‚Üí "20% increase in user financial confidence" (estimate)
- End-User Experience ‚Üí "40% reduction in setup time"
- 401k Product ‚Üí "2x increase in plan participation"
- Distribution Automation ‚Üí "80% reduction in manual processing"

### üé® Week 4: Visual Documentation Upgrade

#### 1. Process Documentation Template
For each project, add:
- **Sketches/Wireframes** (even if you need to recreate)
- **User Journey Maps**
- **Before/After Comparisons**
- **Design System Excerpts**
- **Iteration Examples** (show 2-3 versions)

#### 2. Image Improvements
**Every image needs:**
- Descriptive caption
- Context (when in process)
- Annotations highlighting key decisions
- Proper alt text for accessibility

**Example caption format:**
"Early wireframe exploration showing three navigation patterns we tested. Option B (center) tested best for discoverability while maintaining single-handed reachability on mobile devices."

#### 3. Create "Process Peek" Graphics
Quick graphics showing:
- Research methods used
- Number of iterations
- Testing participants
- Timeline
- Team structure

---

### üìä Weeks 5-6: Polish and Coherence

#### 1. Create Consistent Structure
Every case study should have:
```
1. Overview (Problem, Role, Timeline, Team)
2. Challenge (User needs, Business goals, Constraints)
3. Process (Research, Ideation, Prototyping, Testing)
4. Solution (Final design, Key features, Design decisions)
5. Impact (Metrics, Testimonials, Lessons learned)
6. Responsive Design (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop)
```

#### 2. Write Executive Summaries
Each project needs a 2-3 sentence summary for quick scanning:
"Led the design of Autodesk's self-service platform, reducing provisioning time from days to minutes. Collaborated with engineering to create a flexible system serving 50,000+ users across 15 products. Resulted in 90% reduction in support tickets and $2M annual savings."

#### 3. Add Navigation Improvements
- Create filtering by: Industry, Year, Type (Enterprise/Consumer)
- Add "Similar Projects" links
- Include "Next/Previous" project navigation
- Build a metrics dashboard summarizing all outcomes

---

### üöÄ Week 7-8: Advanced Enhancements

#### 1. Create 2-3 "Hero" Case Studies
Pick your best work and expand significantly:
- 15-20 minute read
- Comprehensive process documentation
- Video walkthroughs
- Stakeholder quotes
- Detailed metrics and analysis

#### 2. Add Interactive Elements
- Figma embed for design system
- CodePen demos for interactions
- Before/after sliders for comparisons
- Interactive prototypes

#### 3. Write Reflection Pieces
- "Lessons from designing for financial behavior"
- "Building design systems in startups"
- "Enterprise vs Consumer: Design approach differences"

### If time is limited:
- Focus on 5-6 strongest projects
- Remove everything else
- Quality over quantity
- Consider hiring a writer for case studies
