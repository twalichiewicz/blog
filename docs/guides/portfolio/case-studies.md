hexo new case-study "Project Name Case Study"
```

## Media Guidelines

- **Screenshots**: High-quality, annotated
- **Data visualizations**: Charts, graphs, metrics

### Organization
```
source/_posts/project-case-study/
├── index.md           # Case study content

├── wireframes/       # Design iterations
├── prototypes/       # Interactive demos
└── results/          # Metrics and outcomes
```

## Writing Best Practices

### Storytelling
1. **Hook**: Start with impact or challenge
2. **Narrative arc**: Problem → Process → Solution → Results
3. **Human element**: Include user quotes and stories
4. **Visuals**: Break up text with images and diagrams

### Professional Tone
- Be specific but not overwhelming
- Explain technical concepts clearly
- Focus on outcomes and learnings
- Maintain confidentiality as needed

### SEO Optimization
- Use descriptive headings
- Include relevant keywords
- Add alt text to images
- Create compelling excerpt

## Interactive Elements

### Embedded Demos
```markdown
{% demo_component "project-demo-name" %}
```

### Before/After Comparisons
```markdown
{% comparison 
  before="./old-design.jpg" 
  after="./new-design.jpg" 
  caption="Redesigned user dashboard" 
%}
```

### Metrics Display
```markdown
{% metrics
  improvement="87%"
  metric="Task completion rate"
