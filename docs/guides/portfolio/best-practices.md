# Portfolio Best Practices

Guidelines for creating compelling portfolio presentations that showcase your work effectively.

## Portfolio Philosophy

Your portfolio should:
- **Tell stories**, not just show artifacts
- **Demonstrate process**, not just outcomes  
- **Show business impact**, not just pretty pictures

- Remove outdated or weak projects regularly

### Project Criteria
Choose projects that show:
- **Impact**: Measurable business/user outcomes
- **Process**: Your thinking and methodology
- **Craft**: Attention to detail and quality
- **Growth**: Evolution of your skills
