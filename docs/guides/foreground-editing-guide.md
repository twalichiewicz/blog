## Example: Before and After

### Before (Current):
"Design systems have become an integral part of modern product development. They serve as a single source of truth for design decisions, patterns, and components. At Foreground, I recognized the need for a comprehensive design system early in my tenure. The company was growing rapidly, and with growth came the inevitable inconsistencies that plague fast-moving startups. Different developers were making different UI decisions, leading to a fragmented user experience..."

### After (Edited):
"Within 3 months of joining Foreground, I identified a critical problem: 90% of our customer support calls were about UI confusion. Our rapid growth had created a fragmented experience - buttons looked different on every page, data was formatted inconsistently, and developers were spending half their time making design decisions. I proposed and built a design system that would solve these issues while handling the unique challenges of financial data visualization."
