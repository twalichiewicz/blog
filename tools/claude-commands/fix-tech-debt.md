Fix the technical debt item: $ARGUMENTS

Follow this systematic approach to address technical debt:

1. **Understand the Issue**
   - Read docs/04-project-health/technical-debt-analysis.md
   - Find the specific item: $ARGUMENTS
   - Use grep/glob to find all files affected by this issue
   - Understand why this is a problem and its impact

2. **Research Current Implementation**
   - Map out all locations where the issue exists
   - Understand dependencies and interconnections
   - Identify why it was implemented this way originally
   - Check git history if needed: `git log -p --grep="$ARGUMENTS"`

3. **Design the Solution**
   - Create a fix that maintains backward compatibility
   - Ensure no functionality is broken
   - Plan for gradual migration if needed
   - Consider edge cases and error scenarios

4. **Implementation Plan**
   - List files that need to be changed
   - Order changes to maintain working state throughout
   - Identify any new files or abstractions needed
   - Plan testing approach

5. **Execute the Fix**
   - Make changes incrementally
   - Test after each significant change
   - Add error handling where appropriate
   - Add comments explaining any complex logic

6. **Testing Protocol**
   - Run `npm run build` after each major change
   - Test affected functionality manually
   - Check for console errors
   - Verify no regressions in other areas

7. **Update Documentation**
   - Update technical debt documentation to mark as resolved
   - Add any new patterns to CLAUDE.md if relevant
   - Document any remaining related issues

8. **Specific Focus Areas by Debt Type**

   **For Duplicate Implementations:**
   - Create single source of truth
   - Add deprecation notices to old versions
   - Update all references systematically

   **For Missing Error Handling:**
   - Add try-catch blocks
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Log errors appropriately
   - Graceful fallbacks

   **For Performance Issues:**
   - Measure before and after
   - Focus on user-perceivable improvements
   - Don't over-optimize

   **For Dependency Issues:**
   - Check for security updates
   - Verify compatibility
   - Update incrementally

Remember: The goal is sustainable improvement, not perfection. It's better to make incremental progress than to attempt a complete rewrite that might introduce new issues.
