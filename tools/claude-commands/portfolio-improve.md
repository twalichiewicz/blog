Please help improve the portfolio project: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. **Read and Analyze**
   - Read the project's markdown file in source/_posts/
   - Take note of what currently exists (images, content, structure)
   - Identify what's missing compared to best-in-class case studies

2. **Evaluate Against Apple Design Leadership Criteria**
   - Process clarity: Is there a clear flow from research → insights → solutions?
   - Visual documentation: Are there sketches, wireframes, prototypes, and final designs?
   - Impact metrics: Are outcomes and business impact clearly stated?
   - Role clarity: Is your specific contribution clear vs team contributions?
   - Design decisions: Are key decisions explained with rationale?

3. **Create Improvement Plan**
   - List specific additions needed (e.g., "Add mobile wireframes", "Include user research findings")
   - Prioritize by impact on the case study quality
   - Estimate effort for each improvement

4. **Implement Improvements**
   - Maintain existing content structure and voice
   - Add new sections where appropriate
   - Ensure all images have descriptive captions
   - Include mobile designs and responsive considerations
   - Add metrics and quantifiable outcomes where possible

5. **Quality Checks**
   - Verify all images load correctly
   - Check that the narrative flows logically
   - Ensure technical details are explained clearly
   - Confirm your role is distinct from team contributions

6. **Build and Test**
   - Run `npm run build` to verify no errors
   - Check that the post renders correctly
   - Ensure images are optimized

Remember: The goal is to tell a compelling story that demonstrates design leadership, not just to add more content. Quality over quantity.
