        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Programming is 90% thinking and 10% typing—now, for real.</p></blockquote><p>This resonates. As the cost of generating code drops to near-zero, the value of <em>deciding what code to write</em> skyrockets. The tools don’t replace the need for engineering rigor; they just move it upstream. We are transitioning from a discipline of syntax management to one of pure system architecture, where the ability to communicate intent is the only hard skill left.</p>]]></content>

      <title>The Inevitable Rise of the Proxy Agent</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Eight months ago, I pivoted my AI project, <a href="https://github.com/Triglavis/proxy-ai-agent/">Tempo</a>, based on a single bet: <strong>The “UI” for the most successful AI agents will eventually disappear.</strong></p><p>At the time, I was building a “Chief of Staff” dashboard—a comprehensive command center for managing calendar invites, emails, and notifications. While technically impressive, I hated using it. It was just another silo to manage, another screen demanding my attention. I had built a better way to view the chaos, but I hadn’t solved it.</p><h2 id="Interaction-Debt-and-the-Pivot-to-Proxy"><a href="#Interaction-Debt-and-the-Pivot-to-Proxy" class="headerlink" title="Interaction Debt and the Pivot to Proxy"></a>Interaction Debt and the Pivot to Proxy</h2><p>We are living through the peak of “Interaction Debt.” Every new AI tool promises to save us time but ultimately demands more of it—asking us to chat, review summaries, or navigate custom interfaces. I realized I didn’t want a better tool to manage my calendar; I wanted a representative to <strong>own</strong> it.</p><p>This led to the core architectural distinction in Tempo: <strong>Chaos Mode vs. Proxy Mode.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Chaos Mode</strong> is the status quo of manual routing. Even with AI assistance, you remain the switchboard operator, clicking “Accept” or “Draft Reply” across disjointed apps.</li><li><strong>Proxy Mode</strong> is the transition to invisible representation. The agent stands <em>in front</em> of the chaos, defending your time and processing information autonomously based on your intent rather than your direct input.</li></ul><h2 id="The-Clawdbot-Signal"><a href="#The-Clawdbot-Signal" class="headerlink" title="The Clawdbot Signal"></a>The Clawdbot Signal</h2><p>I’m seeing this thesis validated in real-time by the sudden popularity of <a href="https://clawd.bot/">Clawdbot</a>.</p><p>On the surface, Clawdbot appears to be just a streamlined interface for Claude. However, its success signals a deeper shift: users are choosing <strong>Representation over Conversation.</strong> Clawdbot wins because it functions as a specialized proxy, stripping away the baggage of the general-purpose “chat” platform to provide a frictionless, direct channel to intelligence. It is the first step toward the “Invisible Core”—where value is defined by autonomous execution rather than interface engagement.</p><h2 id="The-Trust-Bottleneck-A-User-Constitution"><a href="#The-Trust-Bottleneck-A-User-Constitution" class="headerlink" title="The Trust Bottleneck: A User Constitution"></a>The Trust Bottleneck: A User Constitution</h2><p>If the Proxy Agent is inevitable, why isn’t it already standard? The bottleneck isn’t technology; it is trust.</p><p>Moving from a tool that <em>suggests</em> to a proxy that <em>acts</em> requires a massive leap in delegation. You cannot simply hand over your credentials and hope for the best; you need a mechanism to encode your judgment. In Tempo, I addressed this with a “User Constitution.” Instead of a traditional settings page, I built a set of governing principles (e.g. <em>“Prioritize revenue-generating meetings over internal syncs”</em>) that allowed the agent to make decisions aligned with my values.</p><p>To achieve a truly invisible proxy, we must move beyond configuration and toward this kind of explicit framework for autonomy.</p><h2 id="Protocol-over-Platform"><a href="#Protocol-over-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Protocol over Platform"></a>Protocol over Platform</h2><p>If my previous work on <a href="/2026/01/20/Agent-Swarm-Architecture/" title="Agent Swarm Architecture">Agent Swarm Architecture</a> proved that agent <em>architecture</em> is converging on a hierarchy, then projects like Tempo and Clawdbot demonstrate that agent <em>interaction</em> is converging on the proxy.</p><p>We are leaving the “Chat” era and entering the “Representative” era. The next great challenge isn’t making LLMs smarter, but building the protocols that allow these proxies to negotiate, schedule, and coordinate without human intervention. The Proxy Era will truly arrive when our agents can resolve a conflict without either of us ever opening an email.</p><p>The ultimate UI isn’t a better dashboard. It’s the silence of a task already handled.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished reading <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/19/scaling-long-running-autonomous-coding/">Simon Willison’s blog post</a> about <a href="https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents">Wilson Lin’s team’s work at Cursor</a>. I found myself nodding along as I read it—not just because the work is impressive, but because the architectural conclusions they reached felt remarkably familiar.</p><hr><p>Eight months ago, I built <a href="https://github.com/twalichiewicz/meshseeks">MeshSeeks</a>, an MCP server designed to coordinate AI coding agents. Reading about Cursor’s journey felt like watching someone else get punched in the face by the exact same problems I encountered. Interestingly, we both arrived at nearly identical solutions.</p><p>I believe anyone who seriously tackles multi-agent coordination will eventually converge on this specific architecture. The problem space itself seems to have strong opinions on how it wants to be solved.</p><h2 id="The-Architecture-of-Convergence"><a href="#The-Architecture-of-Convergence" class="headerlink" title="The Architecture of Convergence"></a>The Architecture of Convergence</h2><p>Wilson Lin describes Cursor’s final system as a recursive machine: planners explore the codebase and create tasks, often spawning sub-planners to handle specific areas in parallel. Workers pick up these tasks with a singular focus on execution, and at the end of each cycle, a judge agent determines whether the work meets the standard.</p><p>When I looked at what I had built in MeshSeeks, the reflection was almost perfect.</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">                      COORDINATION LAYER</span><br><span class="line">┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐</span><br><span class="line">│                  SwarmOrchestrator                          │</span><br><span class="line">│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐     │</span><br><span class="line">│  │ SessionMgr  │  │CheckpointMgr│  │ AgentPoolManager │     │</span><br><span class="line">│  │ (week-long) │  │(persistence)│  │ (1-500 agents)   │     │</span><br><span class="line">│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └──────────────────┘     │</span><br><span class="line">│                                                             │</span><br><span class="line">│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │</span><br><span class="line">│  │        HierarchicalPlanner (Recursive)               │   │</span><br><span class="line">│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │</span><br><span class="line">│                                                             │</span><br><span class="line">│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │</span><br><span class="line">│  │      JudgeSystem (Automated Verification Loop)       │   │</span><br><span class="line">│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │</span><br><span class="line">└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘</span><br><span class="line">                           │</span><br><span class="line">                           ▼</span><br><span class="line">                  AGENT EXECUTION LAYER</span><br><span class="line">┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐</span><br><span class="line">│             AgentPool (100+ concurrent)                     │</span><br><span class="line">│                                                             │</span><br><span class="line">│  🔍 Analysis    ⚙️ Implement    🧪 Test      📝 Doc         │</span><br><span class="line">│  🐛 Debug       🎯 Judge        📋 Plan                     │</span><br><span class="line">└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The parallels were striking. Where Cursor solved planning scale by having planners spawn sub-planners, I had implemented a <code>HierarchicalPlanner</code> with a recursive decomposition method. We both solved the “lazy worker” problem by enforcing strict role specialization—separating the “deciding” from the “doing.” And perhaps most importantly, we both realized that you can’t have a human in the loop for every decision, nor can you trust an agent to grade its own homework. You need a dedicated Judge.</p><p>Neither of us planned it this way from the start. We evolved into it because every other option failed.</p><h2 id="The-Failures-That-Teach-You"><a href="#The-Failures-That-Teach-You" class="headerlink" title="The Failures That Teach You"></a>The Failures That Teach You</h2><p>The most valuable part of Cursor’s post was their honest accounting of those failures. Their initial approach gave agents equal status, letting them self-coordinate via a shared file. This is the obvious first attempt, and it is almost always the wrong one.</p><p>Cursor found that locking mechanisms became throughput killers, noting that “twenty agents would slow down to the effective throughput of two or three.” I hit this exact wall in MeshSeeks. My first iteration had agents coordinating through a shared task queue that quickly became a massive chokepoint. Agents spent more time checking the queue and locking resources than actually working, causing the coordination overhead to scale quadratically.</p><p>The fix was to abandon the flat structure entirely in favor of strict hierarchy. In MeshSeeks, the <code>HierarchicalPlanner</code> owns the task tree. Workers don’t talk to each other; they receive tasks from the planner and report results back. This simple change reduced coordination overhead from O(n^2) to O(n).</p><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// From hierarchical-planner.ts</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">interface</span> <span class="title class_">HierarchicalTask</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">id</span>: <span class="built_in">string</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">parentId</span>: <span class="built_in">string</span> | <span class="literal">null</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">depth</span>: <span class="built_in">number</span>;              <span class="comment">// 0 = root, max 5</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">children</span>: <span class="built_in">string</span>[];         <span class="comment">// Child task IDs</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">status</span>: <span class="title class_">TaskStatus</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Workers don&#x27;t see other workers&#x27; tasks</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// They only see their assignment</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Beyond performance, the flat structure created a fascinating behavioral problem: risk aversion. Cursor noted that without hierarchy, “agents became risk-averse,” avoiding difficult tasks to make small, safe changes instead. I saw the same game-theoretic nightmare. When agents are peers, the Nash equilibrium is a swarm of agents effectively bikeshedding on easy tasks while the hard problems rot. Hierarchy solves this by removing the choice. The planner decides what needs to happen, and the worker executes. There is no opportunity for strategic avoidance.</p><p>We also both learned that conflict resolution cannot happen in real-time. Cursor tried an “integrator” role to manage conflicts but found it became a bottleneck. I learned the same lesson and built a <code>JudgeSystem</code> instead.</p><p>In MeshSeeks, the judge acts less like a manager and more like a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline with an opinion. It runs unit tests, checks linting, and performs a semantic review against the original requirements. If the tests pass but the logic is brittle, the Judge rejects the task with specific rework instructions. The distinction is critical: an integrator sits in the critical path (push-based), while a judge evaluates completed work asynchronously (pull-based).</p><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// From judge-system.ts</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">interface</span> <span class="title class_">JudgeCriterion</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">type</span>: <span class="string">&#x27;correctness&#x27;</span> | <span class="string">&#x27;completeness&#x27;</span> | <span class="string">&#x27;quality&#x27;</span> | <span class="string">&#x27;testing&#x27;</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">weight</span>: <span class="built_in">number</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">enabled</span>: <span class="built_in">boolean</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">passThreshold</span>: <span class="built_in">number</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Why-Recursive-Planning-Matters"><a href="#Why-Recursive-Planning-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Recursive Planning Matters"></a>Why Recursive Planning Matters</h2><p>Complex software projects have a fractal structure.

They found that different models excel at different roles—for example, GPT-5.2 is better for planning, while other models might be better suited for raw coding. I had built MeshSeeks to be model-agnostic, but I hadn’t optimized the model-to-role fit. This is a clear area for improvement.</p><p>They also reinforced that prompts matter more than architecture. I spent more time tuning system prompts than writing coordination logic. If you get the prompt wrong, the agent ignores your fancy architecture and reverts to its base training.</p><h2 id="The-Sweet-Spot"><a href="#The-Sweet-Spot" class="headerlink" title="The Sweet Spot"></a>The Sweet Spot</h2><p>If you are coordinating more than a handful of agents on a complex project, the problem forces you into a specific shape. You need hierarchical planning to handle the scope, role separation to keep agents focused, and an asynchronous judge to ensure quality. You need checkpoints because systems crash. And you need to eliminate peer-to-peer coordination because it doesn’t scale.</p><p>It’s not about being clever. It’s about survival. Flat structures don’t scale, unguided agents are lazy, and synchronous integration is a bottleneck. Cursor’s post is validating because it suggests this architecture is robust enough for arbitrarily complex projects.</p><p>The question is no longer “Can we coordinate hundreds of agents?” but “How do we standardize the protocol between them?” If we can agree on the interface for a Planner, Worker, and Judge, we might finally move beyond building swarms and start building the operating system that runs them.</p><hr><p><em>MeshSeeks is open source at <a href="https://github.com/twalichiewicz/meshseeks">github.com&#x2F;twalichiewicz&#x2F;meshseeks</a>.</em></p>]]></content>

      <title>Apple Gaming Strategy</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s gaming strategy is so bizarre. Early on it basically was the platform for gaming (remember when Halo was previewed at MacWorld? (What sort of weird alternate timeline would we have had if Apple bought it instead of Microsoft? Would there even be an Xbox?)) and it again regained that title, but as a side effect of the iPhone’s portable-but-powerful platform.</p><p>But their current strategy seems lacking.</p><ul><li>Why isn’t there an integration with Steam? You’re not getting around the fact that people have huge collections of purchases on that platform, so having some way to not double-purchase by linking your Steam and App Store accounts would already help.</li><li>This new Games app is basically just the App Store but pared down without the junk.</li><li>Why doesn’t Apple have an in-house porting team? If a company like Nightdive can come in and fill the gap by porting classic titles to modern platforms, I’m sure Apple could pull their weight to help convince developers.</li></ul><p>People always mention how macOS isn’t a large enough platform to justify developing games for it, but I’d argue that if more games supported it (and ran well), why would anyone want to have to buy both a Mac and a PC? They could accelerate this effort by taking a similar strategy to what Sony did to reverse their fortunes in the 360&#x2F;PS3 era—find the top-tier, critically acclaimed games and port those to macOS. That alone would shift the conversation to “Well, with a Mac I’ll always be able to play the top games, but maybe I miss out on the random indie stuff.”</p>]]></content>

      <title>The End of Command-Based Computing</title>
      <link href="/2025/08/09/The-End-of-Command-Based-Computing/"/>
      <url>/2025/08/09/The-End-of-Command-Based-Computing/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-50-Year-Old-Assumption"><a href="#A-50-Year-Old-Assumption" class="headerlink" title="A 50-Year-Old Assumption"></a>A 50-Year-Old Assumption</h2><p>In 1975, when Bill Gates and Paul Allen created BASIC for the Altair 8800, they made a reasonable choice: computers would wait for human commands. This made sense. Computers were tools, like hammers or typewriters. You tell them what to do, they do it.</p><p>But somewhere along the way, we stopped questioning whether this should remain true. We’ve spent fifty years making commands easier—GUIs, voice assistants, chatbots—without asking if commands themselves are the problem.</p><p>Here’s what this has cost us: According to Asana’s 2023 study of 9,615 knowledge workers, we spend 58% of our workday on “work about work.” Not creating. Not solving. Just coordinating. Research shows we waste nearly a full workday each week just searching for information. Those juggling 16 or more apps could save almost 10 hours weekly through better processes. We’ve built a $50 trillion global economy where most work isn’t work at all.</p><h2 id="What-I’m-Building"><a href="#What-I’m-Building" class="headerlink" title="What I’m Building"></a>What I’m Building</h2><p>I’m developing WorkspaceOS—software that observes patterns in how you work and begins acting on them without being asked. Not automation (which follows preset rules), but pattern recognition that compounds over time.</p><p>Here’s how it works:</p><p>WorkspaceOS uses computer vision to understand what’s on your screen—no API integrations needed. This means it works with legacy enterprise software, brand new tools, and everything in between. Processing happens locally on your device, your data never leaves your control. The system observes sequences of actions and their contexts: when I check the same three log files whenever our payment system throws errors, it learns to pre-fetch and highlight relevant sections when similar errors occur. When I switch between projects and open our analytics dashboard after modifying the pricing model, it knows I’m checking for impact and prepares the relevant comparisons without being asked.</p><p>Instead of sending every action to expensive cloud models, WorkspaceOS caches learned patterns locally. First time WorkspaceOS sees a pattern: $0.10. Every time after: $0.001. This isn’t a discount—it’s architectural. The system gets more valuable with use, not through updates, but through interaction.</p><h2 id="Three-Key-Capabilities"><a href="#Three-Key-Capabilities" class="headerlink" title="Three Key Capabilities"></a>Three Key Capabilities</h2><style>.pillars-container {  margin: 1.5rem auto;  max-width: 65ch;  position: relative;}.pillar {  margin: 2rem 0;  position: relative;  padding-left: 3.5rem;}.pillar-number {  position: absolute;  left: 3px;  top: -6px;  width: 36px;  height: 36px;  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a1a 0%, #2d2d2d 100%);  border: 2px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);  border-radius: 50%;  display: flex;  align-items: center;  justify-content: center;  font-weight: 900;  font-size: 1.1rem;  color: white;  box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);}.pillar-title {  font-size: 1.3rem;  font-weight: 700;  line-height: 111%;  margin-bottom: 3px;  color: var(--text-primary);  letter-spacing: -0.02em;}.pillar-subtitle {  font-size: 12px;  text-transform: uppercase;  letter-spacing: 0.08em;  opacity: 0.6;  margin-bottom: 0;  font-weight: 600;}.pillar-content {  margin-top: 9px;  line-height: 1.5;  color: var(--text-secondary);}.pillar-highlight {  background: linear-gradient(120deg, #374151 0%, #1f2937 100%);  -webkit-background-clip: text;  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;  background-clip: text;  font-weight: 700;}@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {  .pillar-number {    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0f0f0f 0%, #1f1f1f 100%);    border: 2px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);    box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);  }  .pillar-highlight {    background: linear-gradient(120deg, #ffffff 0%, #d1d5db 100%);    -webkit-background-clip: text;    -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;    background-clip: text;  }}@media (max-width: 768px) {  .pillar {    padding-left: 3rem;  }  .pillar-number {    width: 32px;    height: 32px;    font-size: 1rem;  }}</style><div class="pillars-container"><div class="pillar"><div class="pillar-number">1</div><div class="pillar-title">Universal Compatibility</div><div class="pillar-subtitle">Works with any software</div><div class="pillar-content">Computer vision at the OS level means it works with any application on your screen.

It removes friction, not judgment. Privacy-preserving pattern sharing between users is still in research—your patterns stay yours for now.</div><h2 id="The-Trajectory"><a href="#The-Trajectory" class="headerlink" title="The Trajectory"></a>The Trajectory</h2><p>Right now, WorkspaceOS reduces my coordination overhead by about 40%. That’s real, measured by time tracking my own workflows before and after implementation. Not revolutionary yet, but meaningful. The interesting part isn’t the current state—it’s the compound effect. Every pattern learned makes the next pattern easier to recognize. Every workflow understood enables more complex anticipation. The system I’m using today is noticeably smarter than six months ago, without any architectural changes. When this approach matures, work changes fundamentally. Not because entire professions disappear, but because the friction between intention and execution evaporates. You stop being a command-line interface for your computer and start doing what you were actually hired to do. The command paradigm that has defined computing for fifty years doesn’t need evolution. It needs retirement.</p><p><strong><a href="https://tryworkspaceos.com/">WorkspaceOS</a></strong></p><p><em>Currently in development.

      <title>Designing Forward: Rethinking How Users Reach Success in AI-Powered Builders</title>
      <link href="/2025/07/23/Designing-Forward-AI-Powered-Builders/"/>
      <url>/2025/07/23/Designing-Forward-AI-Powered-Builders/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was invited to an onsite at Replit, the design challenge they posed was simple on paper:</p><p><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 15px;">“How might we help users reach a successful outcome faster?”</span></p><p>In practice, that question cuts to the heart of a major problem in AI-native creation tools. Users enter a vague idea, hit “Build,” and are met with silence or a failed attempt. They’re not just asking a system to generate code, they’re trying to collaborate with something that gives them no real sense of whether it understood what they meant.</p><p>During that onsite, I spent the day mapping out the problem, pinpointing the breakdowns, and sketching a layered system that could guide users more effectively. Some of what I proposed now appears in their product. Whether that’s correlation or causation isn’t really the point. The ideas are out there now, and the bigger conversation is overdue.</p><p>So I’m publishing my original thinking here—not just to timestamp it, but to push the discussion forward. This isn’t just a Replit problem. Teams at OpenAI, Meta, Apple Intelligence, Perplexity, and DeepMind are all navigating the same underlying issue.</p><h2 id="The-Core-Problem-Prompt-in-failure-out"><a href="#The-Core-Problem-Prompt-in-failure-out" class="headerlink" title="The Core Problem: Prompt-in, failure-out"></a>The Core Problem: Prompt-in, failure-out</h2><p>Most AI builders start with a blank prompt box and a “Build” button. That’s it. The assumptions are:</p><ul><li>Users know what to say</li><li>The system will know what to do with it</li><li>If something breaks, the user will know how to fix it</li></ul><p>But in reality, especially for non-technical users, it goes more like this:</p><ul><li>The system misinterprets the request</li><li>The output is broken or misaligned</li><li>The user has no idea what went wrong or how to adjust</li></ul><p>After two or three failed attempts, people bounce.</p><h2 id="The-Deeper-Issue-It’s-not-the-engine-it’s-the-mapping"><a href="#The-Deeper-Issue-It’s-not-the-engine-it’s-the-mapping" class="headerlink" title="The Deeper Issue: It’s not the engine, it’s the mapping"></a>The Deeper Issue: It’s not the engine, it’s the mapping</h2><p>Models aren’t the problem. The real issue is that most AI tools have no translation layer between human intention and system execution. There’s no mechanism for negotiation, no signal about whether the system understands, and no scaffolding to help the user refine what they meant.</p><p>It’s like trying to build something with a team member who never asks questions and never says what they’re thinking.</p><p>We need to stop designing prompts as one-way input and start treating them like a two-way conversation.</p><h2 id="The-Solution-I-Proposed-A-Layered-UX-System-for-Clarity-and-Feedback"><a href="#The-Solution-I-Proposed-A-Layered-UX-System-for-Clarity-and-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="The Solution I Proposed: A Layered UX System for Clarity and Feedback"></a>The Solution I Proposed: A Layered UX System for Clarity and Feedback</h2><p>I presented a design framework structured around four key elements. The goal was simple—help users move from ambiguity to alignment before anything is built.</p><h3 id="1-Inline-Prompt-Validation"><a href="#1-Inline-Prompt-Validation" class="headerlink" title="1. Inline Prompt Validation"></a>1. Inline Prompt Validation</h3><p>As users type, the system evaluates what they’re saying and offers suggestions or clarifying questions.</p><ul><li>“Try adding more detail about the UI”</li><li>“Looks like you’re building a CRUD app, what’s the data model?”</li><li>“Ambiguous term detected, did you mean X or Y?”</li></ul><p>This doesn’t interrupt the flow, it enhances it.</p><h3 id="2-Mini-Agent-Co-Pilot"><a href="#2-Mini-Agent-Co-Pilot" class="headerlink" title="2. Mini-Agent Co-Pilot"></a>2. Mini-Agent Co-Pilot</h3><p>A lightweight background agent continuously parses the prompt, offering micro-interventions where needed.</p><p>Think of it like a PM in your input box—flagging blockers, suggesting reusable templates, and steering you before you go off-course.</p><h3 id="3-Confidence-Meter-on-the-Build-Button"><a href="#3-Confidence-Meter-on-the-Build-Button" class="headerlink" title="3. Confidence Meter on the Build Button"></a>3. Confidence Meter on the Build Button</h3><p>Instead of a binary “Build” button, show a signal about how confident the system is in its ability to generate something viable.</p><p>It lowers anxiety, builds trust, and teaches users what kind of input leads to better results.</p><h3 id="4-Netflix-Style-Preview-Cards"><a href="#4-Netflix-Style-Preview-Cards" class="headerlink" title="4. Netflix-Style Preview Cards"></a>4. Netflix-Style Preview Cards</h3><p>Above the prompt, surface 2–3 interpretations of what the system thinks the user wants to make.</p><ul><li>A chat app with login and chatroom</li><li>A note-taking app with tags and markdown</li><li>A portfolio site with sections and deployment config</li></ul><p>This gives users something tangible to react to, helping them clarify their own intent.</p><h2 id="The-Long-Term-Vision-Parallel-Agents-for-Real-Time-Collaboration"><a href="#The-Long-Term-Vision-Parallel-Agents-for-Real-Time-Collaboration" class="headerlink" title="The Long-Term Vision: Parallel Agents for Real-Time Collaboration"></a>The Long-Term Vision: Parallel Agents for Real-Time Collaboration</h2><p>The four-pillar system above is a strong MVP. But what really unlocks long-term value is rethinking the architecture altogether—not just how the interface guides users, but how the system thinks alongside them.</p><p>In the vision I sketched, the future of AI-powered builders isn’t a single black box that you prompt and hope for the best. It’s a collaborative system where multiple AI agents operate in parallel—each specializing in a distinct layer of the software creation process, just like real product teams.</p><h3 id="A-The-Lightweight-Agent-Your-Product-Strategist-in-the-Loop"><a href="#A-The-Lightweight-Agent-Your-Product-Strategist-in-the-Loop" class="headerlink" title="A. The Lightweight Agent: Your Product Strategist in the Loop"></a>A. The Lightweight Agent: Your Product Strategist in the Loop</h3><p>This agent’s job isn’t to build. It’s to understand, scope, prioritize, and clarify.<br>It constantly monitors what the user is trying to achieve and translates that intent into something actionable. Think of it as:</p><ul><li>Asking timely clarification questions</li><li>Reframing vague goals into concrete features</li><li>Flagging risky assumptions early</li><li>Helping the user refine what done looks like</li></ul><p>It’s the AI equivalent of a good product manager or tech lead—someone who doesn’t just nod and build, but asks, “What problem are we actually solving?”</p><p>This agent could live in the prompt input itself, or as a side-thread&#x2F;chat layer that occasionally taps the user on the shoulder with questions like:</p><ul><li>“Are user accounts required?”</li><li>“Would you like to store data locally or in the cloud?”</li><li>“Do you want to start with a scaffolded UI or raw code?”</li></ul><p>The point isn’t just to fill gaps—it’s to make sure the user is solving the right problem in the right way.</p><h3 id="B-The-Heavyweight-Agent-Your-Builder-Deployer-and-Debugger"><a href="#B-The-Heavyweight-Agent-Your-Builder-Deployer-and-Debugger" class="headerlink" title="B. The Heavyweight Agent: Your Builder, Deployer, and Debugger"></a>B. The Heavyweight Agent: Your Builder, Deployer, and Debugger</h3><p>Once intent is clear, the second agent takes over execution—handling everything from scaffold generation to deployment to runtime configuration. It doesn’t just generate code, it operationalizes it.</p><p>Its responsibilities might include:</p><ul><li>Translating the scoped request into clean, runnable code</li><li>Creating project structure and config files</li><li>Spinning up development environments or preview links</li><li>Surfacing build-time errors in a human-readable way</li><li>Offering next steps (e.g. “add login,” “connect to database”)</li></ul><p>If the lightweight agent is the thinker, the heavyweight agent is the doer.</p><h3 id="Why-Parallelism-Matters"><a href="#Why-Parallelism-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Parallelism Matters"></a>Why Parallelism Matters</h3><p>In most tools today, this kind of division doesn’t exist. The system either builds or doesn’t. It doesn’t negotiate, doesn’t clarify, and certainly doesn’t improve mid-stream.</p><p>But real product teams work in parallel. Strategy and execution feed into each other continuously. Questions are raised and resolved as part of the flow, not as separate stages. This is what makes collaboration fast, effective, and adaptable.</p><p>Bringing that dynamic into AI-native tooling means:</p><ul><li>Fewer dead-ends, because ambiguity gets resolved up front</li><li>Higher success rates, because output is based on clarified goals</li><li>More user learning, because the system explains itself as it goes</li></ul><p>Eventually, this dual-agent system could be extended even further: with a design agent for UI scaffolding, a data agent for schema management, or a QA agent for test coverage and performance optimization. But the core starts with two minds—thinking and building—working together in real time.</p><h2 id="Why-This-Matters"><a href="#Why-This-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why This Matters"></a>Why This Matters</h2><p>AI-native builders have the potential to fundamentally change how software gets created. But they’ll only reach that potential if we stop treating the user experience as a secondary concern.</p><p>The frontier isn’t more horsepower. It’s better conversation.</p><p>If the system doesn’t clarify, guide, or explain, then intent gets lost, trust breaks down, and even the best model won’t be able to deliver.</p>]]></content>

Nothing worse than it queuing up the same “recommended” songs that just played 30 minutes ago when you were in a different playlist.</p><p>Maybe keep track of the last 50 songs played?

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Found a stack of my old design notebooks tucked away in a drawer today. Pages filled with sketches, half-formed ideas, and that particular kind of energy that comes from putting pen to paper without overthinking it.</p><p>There’s something about the tactile process of sketching that digital tools can’t quite replicate. The weight of the pencil, the texture of paper, the way ideas flow more freely when your hand is moving. Those notebooks captured a rawness and immediacy that made me want to bring some of that spirit back to my work.</p><p>Felt inspired enough to completely redo the Works page.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As LinkedIn’s AI hacks flooded my feed, one pattern was impossible to miss: “Midjourney just gave me 50 logos.” “ChatGPT wrote all my button copy.” We’re in tech’s oldest loop—new tool, same tasks, just faster. It echoed a lesson from photography class: early photographers spent decades making photos look like paintings.</p><p>When photography was invented in 1839, practitioners pointed their cameras at the same subjects painters had captured for centuries. They used soft focus and hand-tinting, desperately trying to gain artistic legitimacy by mimicking the established medium. It took nearly 50 years before photographers like Alfred Stieglitz proclaimed that it was “high time that the stupidity and sham in pictorial photography be struck a solarplexus blow.”</p><p>Photography had to find its own voice—exactly the opportunity we face with AI.</p><p>This pattern repeats throughout history. Cinema spent its first decades as “filmed theater.” Early websites looked like printed newspapers. And today? We have revolutionary AI tools, but we’re mostly using them as faster interns. We’re repeating history, and we don’t even see it.</p><h2 id="The-four-phases-of-any-medium"><a href="#The-four-phases-of-any-medium" class="headerlink" title="The four phases of any medium"></a>The four phases of any medium</h2><p>Every creative medium follows the same predictable arc:</p><p><strong>Phase 1: Imitation</strong> - New tech mimics what came before<br><strong>Phase 2: Experimentation</strong> - Pioneers start breaking rules<br><strong>Phase 3: Unique Voice</strong> - The medium finds what only it can do<br><strong>Phase 4: Maturation</strong> - It transforms everything else</p><p>(These are rough historical averages, not laws of physics.)</p><p>Photography took 50 years to freeze time. Cinema needed 30 to discover editing. The web, 20 to go responsive.</p><p>VR still hunts for its freeze-time moment; LLMs have already had theirs (and they’re only getting louder).</p><h2 id="Most-of-us-are-stuck-in-Phase-1"><a href="#Most-of-us-are-stuck-in-Phase-1" class="headerlink" title="Most of us are stuck in Phase 1"></a>Most of us are stuck in Phase 1</h2><p>The evolution is happening faster than we think. In 2024, Figma found that <span class="stat-container"><span class="stat-number" data-value="72">72%</span> of teams said AI played only a minor role</span><sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. By mid-2025, <span class="stat-container"><span class="stat-number" data-value="64">64%</span> of those same teams had shipped at least one AI-powered feature</span>, up from <span class="stat-container"><span class="stat-number" data-value="28">28%</span> the year prior</span><sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. The 2025 State of AI in Design Report by Foundation Capital shows <span class="stat-container"><span class="stat-number" data-value="89">89%</span> of designers say AI has improved their workflow</span><sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. That’s not incremental progress. That’s a phase shift.</p><p>But here’s the pattern: <span class="stat-container"><span class="stat-number" data-value="84">84%</span> use AI for exploration</span>, while only <span class="stat-container"><span class="stat-number" data-value="39">39%</span> use it for final delivery</span><sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. Great at brainstorms and prototypes; timid with ship-ready work.</p><p>Those numbers suggest a mass migration from Phase 1 to early Phase 2, while a fringe is sprinting toward Phase 3 and beyond.</p><p>I deliberately switched from Swift to Rust, letting Claude mentor me 24&#x2F;7. A weekend’s grind collapsed into a single evening sprint. Not because AI was doing my work, but because it was translating between my design thinking and code syntax. Between what I could imagine and what I could build.</p><p>This wasn’t automation. It was amplification.</p><p>The speed of evolution is unprecedented. According to the same report, <span class="stat-container"><span class="stat-number" data-value="96">96%</span> of designers are self-taught in AI</span><sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>, learning from peers and social posts rather than formal training. What took photography clubs months through quarterly journals happens in minutes on Reddit.</p><h2 id="The-adoption-curve-is-splitting"><a href="#The-adoption-curve-is-splitting" class="headerlink" title="The adoption curve is splitting"></a>The adoption curve is splitting</h2><p>Here’s what the data doesn’t capture: while most designers are using AI for “exploration,” a small group has already jumped to Phase 3 or 4.</p><p>I co-craft prompts in Discord channels where yesterday’s hacks ship as today’s SaaS. Like <a href="https://www.krea.ai/">Krea.ai</a>, where artists use real-time generation to paint with AI as a living brush (think Photoshop, but the brushstroke is generated in real time by the model). Or developers building entire SaaS products by describing functions rather than coding them—like Perplexity’s real-time custom agents.</p><p>The real evolution might be happening in the margins. Maybe prompt engineering <em>is</em> the new creative medium. Maybe the conversation itself—the back-and-forth between human intent and machine possibility—is the breakthrough. Six months ago I specced a chat-loop workflow that felt like sci-fi; this week, GPT-4o’s streaming API let me ship it in a day.</p><p>The implication hit harder than the code itself.</p><p>For the first time, I could imagine being a solo founder. Hitting “deploy” on a functioning SaaS by lunch made something click: it felt like having a team; the usual barriers just weren’t there.</p><p>(Yes, most weekend SaaS die—but the cost of trying has collapsed.)</p><p>That power is double-edged: models can hollow out junior roles. We won’t slow the shift, but we can shape governance and talent pipelines.</p><p>We’re so busy debating whether AI has found its voice that we’re missing the obvious: it already has. We just don’t have the vocabulary to describe it yet.</p><p>The teenagers know. The solo founders building million-dollar companies from their bedrooms know. The artists making AI hallucinate between realities know. They’re not waiting for AI to evolve. They’re already living in Phase 4.</p><p>Most teams are still polishing AI demo reels while Phase-4 builders ship features that were sci-fi in January. Ship a coffee-break prototype once and you can’t un-learn it.</p><p><strong>So, where are you on the curve?</strong></p><div class="references-section"><div class="references-list"><ol><li id="ref1">Figma's 2024 survey of 1,800 users. <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/ai-design-figma-users-tell-us-whats-coming-next/">Full report</a>.</li><li id="ref2">Figma's 2025 AI Report. <a href="https://www.figma.com/reports/ai-2025/">Full report</a>.</li><li id="ref3">The 2025 State of AI in Design Report by Foundation Capital and Designer Fund. <a href="https://www.stateofaidesign.com">Full methodology</a>.</li></ol></div></div>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple bringing 3D window management from SpatialOS to macOS has me thinking: why not add a z-axis to desktop interactions?</p><p>The current 2D window stack feels increasingly limiting. We’re managing dozens of apps, countless browser tabs, and multiple workspaces (all constrained to x and y coordinates). Meanwhile, our spatial reasoning capabilities remain largely untapped.</p><p>Imagine grabbing a window by its title bar and pushing it “back” into space, where it scales down and slides behind your active work. Not hidden, not minimized (just contextually receded). Designers could keep inspiration boards floating behind their canvas. Developers could layer documentation behind their IDE.</p><div class="video-container">  <video controls playsinline style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 24px 0;" autoplay loop muted>        <source src="macOS26_spatialOS26.webm" type="video/webm">    <source src="macOS26_spatialOS26.mp4" type="video/mp4">    Your browser does not support the video tag.  </video></div><p style="text-align: center; color: #666; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: -16px;">A window being dragged "into" the screen, shrinking as it moves behind other windows on the z-axis</p><p>Here’s where it gets interesting: with shared spatial metadata between macOS and SpatialOS, your window arrangements could persist across devices. And if they leverage their foveated rendering tech, we could get natural parallax effects as you move your cursor (or your head in Vision Pro). Mission Control transforms from a flat grid into a truly spatial command center.</p><h2 id="The-clever-bits"><a href="#The-clever-bits" class="headerlink" title="The clever bits"></a>The <span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #9D00FF 0%, #FF00F5 100%); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; background-clip: text; font-weight: 600;">clever</span> bits</h2><ul><li>Window depth as process priority: That Gmail tab five layers back becomes a literal background process. macOS could throttle CPU cycles based on z-position.</li><li>Eye tracking and foveated rendering mean that peripheral windows could render at lower resolution so your computer stops wasting resources on things you’re not looking at</li><li>Ultra Wideband positioning could make window arrangements location-aware. Walk into the kitchen with your laptop, and your cooking videos and recipe tabs automatically move forward. Head to the office, and work documents take focus. The z-axis becomes context-aware.</li></ul><p>I’m starting to think we’ve been stuck in flatland for too long.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looks like Apple is ending the iOS Photos.app interaction paradigm experiment with bimodal swipe-to-switch state. I get why they tried it—a navigation bar for only 2 modes feels like overkill. But a hidden gesture was probably too subtle.</p><p>The eternal UI challenge: when you have exactly two modes, every solution feels wrong. Too few for a nav bar, too important for a buried gesture. It’s like the dropdown rule—you need 3+ options to justify the pattern.</p>]]></content>

This might have been amazing back in the early 2000’s when car infotainment systems were a running joke, but now this is being compared against <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/rivians-new-cel-shaded-infotainment-update-is-cool-and-mandatory">Rivian</a>, <a href="https://lucidowners.com/threads/some-ui-screenshots-gravity-software-v-3-07.12085/">Lucid</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GalOmedUCoo">Volvo</a>, and others.</p><p>Apple pitches Ultra as “deeply integrated and fully skinnable,” but Aston’s launch video shows the stock iOS palette pasted over six-figure craftsmanship. Meanwhile, the flat-grey HVAC sliders ignore the cabin’s knurled toggles, and the music widget’s left-to-right progress bar falls directly under a right-hand steering-wheel spoke—neither is a fatal flaw, but both scream phone app rather than GT cockpit.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Gut-check before opening Figma</title>
      <link href="/2025/04/07/Gut-check-before-opening-Figma/"/>
      <url>/2025/04/07/Gut-check-before-opening-Figma/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s a familiar rush that comes from opening Figma right away. You drop in some frames, start sketching flows, and before long, the canvas is full of ideas. It feels like momentum. Like progress. Like designing. But if you watched my process, you’d mostly see Post-Its, notebooks, and long moments of quiet thinking. I spend a surprising amount of time just trying to understand what life really looks like for the people I’m designing for. I review my assumptions, draw rough ideas by hand, and then go back—again and again—until something clicks.</p><p>This slower front-end of the process is the reason projects I lead tend to ship on time and get built right. It’s why users often tell us, “This is so much better.” It’s how we move the metrics that actually matter. The truth is, design isn’t about moving fast or making things look cool. It’s not about trends, or gimmicks, or the next shiny idea. Good design is about certainty—certainty that you’re solving the right problem, that you understand the user’s world, and that what you’re building will have a meaningful impact.</p><p>Here’s a rough idea of my self-limiter, <strong>The Figma Gut-Check</strong>:</p><ol><li>Can I describe the user’s world so clearly they’d say, “That’s me”?<br> → If not, I haven’t earned the right to design for them.</li><li>Can I write the problem in a single sentence, without buzzwords?<br> → If not, I don’t understand it deeply enough.</li><li>Can I explain how this work connects to product or business goals?<br> → If not, it’s just surface-level polish.</li><li>Can I tell the story of how this design helps—without showing a screen?<br> → If not, the pixels won’t land.</li></ol><p>If I can’t answer these with clarity, I’m not ready to start pixel pushing.</p><p>It’s easy to look like you’re moving fast when you rush into Figma, but more often than not, that speed masks confusion. Slowing down—taking time to think, to understand, to align—creates a foundation for speed later. You make sharper decisions because they’re rooted in clarity. You stay close to your user’s evolving experience. And in that closeness, insights surface more naturally, more often. That’s the secret: good design doesn’t move fast. It moves with purpose. And it always starts with clarity.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Full-stack product designers:</strong><br>Strategy, UX, UI, prototyping, maybe even shipping code. The role sounds like a dream, but most teams don’t know how to actually use it.</p><p>I’ve often been brought on because I work this way— across product strategy, cross-product systems, AI tooling, and UX design. The job is about seeing the big picture, stitching together product intent, and making sure the execution supports it end to end.</p><p>But here’s what I’ve learned:<br>Full-stack doesn’t mean “do everything.”<br>It means “connect everything.”</p><p>Too often, companies hire this kind of designer… then unintentionally limit their impact. They get stuck in handoff loops, vague ownership zones, or left out of key product decisions entirely.</p><p>If you’re hiring for a designer who can go end-to-end, here’s what actually sets them up for success:<br> • Involve them early in framing the problem, not just shaping the UI<br> • Give them access to context, not just tasks<br> • Trust them to lead cross-functionally, not just design individually<br> • Let them define what done looks like, not just what pretty looks like</p><p>When done well, this role becomes a force multiplier. Not just for speed but for clarity, alignment, and momentum. The orgs that recognize that (and build the structure to support it) will attract and retain a different caliber of designer.</p><h2 id="Full-Stack-Designer-Skills-Matrix"><a href="#Full-Stack-Designer-Skills-Matrix" class="headerlink" title="Full-Stack Designer Skills Matrix"></a>Full-Stack Designer Skills Matrix</h2><h3 id="Core-Design-Skills-Foundation"><a href="#Core-Design-Skills-Foundation" class="headerlink" title="Core Design Skills (Foundation)"></a>Core Design Skills (Foundation)</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Skill</th><th>Junior</th><th>Mid</th><th>Senior</th><th>Staff+</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Visual Design</strong></td><td>Follow guidelines</td><td>Create cohesive interfaces</td><td>Define visual language</td><td>Set org-wide standards</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Interaction Design</strong></td><td>Basic patterns</td><td>Complex flows</td><td>System thinking</td><td>Innovation in patterns</td></tr><tr><td><strong>User Research</strong></td><td>Assist in sessions</td><td>Lead studies</td><td>Synthesize insights</td><td>Research strategy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Information Architecture</strong></td><td>Page-level IA</td><td>Feature-level IA</td><td>Product-level IA</td><td>Ecosystem IA</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Extended-Skills-The-“Stack”"><a href="#Extended-Skills-The-“Stack”" class="headerlink" title="Extended Skills (The “Stack”)"></a>Extended Skills (The “Stack”)</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Skill</th><th>Junior</th><th>Mid</th><th>Senior</th><th>Staff+</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Product Strategy</strong></td><td>Understand goals</td><td>Contribute to roadmap</td><td>Define features</td><td>Shape product vision</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frontend Code</strong></td><td>HTML&#x2F;CSS basics</td><td>React components</td><td>Design systems code</td><td>Architecture decisions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Data &amp; Analytics</strong></td><td>Read dashboards</td><td>Define metrics</td><td>Analysis &amp; insights</td><td>Data-driven strategy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Business Acumen</strong></td><td>Know the industry</td><td>Understand P&amp;L</td><td>ROI calculations</td><td>Business model design</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Multiplier-Skills"><a href="#Multiplier-Skills" class="headerlink" title="Multiplier Skills"></a>Multiplier Skills</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Skill</th><th>Junior</th><th>Mid</th><th>Senior</th><th>Staff+</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Systems Thinking</strong></td><td>Component level</td><td>Feature level</td><td>Product level</td><td>Organization level</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stakeholder Management</strong></td><td>Update progress</td><td>Manage expectations</td><td>Influence decisions</td><td>Drive consensus</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Technical Communication</strong></td><td>Document designs</td><td>API discussions</td><td>Architecture reviews</td><td>Tech strategy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Team Leadership</strong></td><td>Peer collaboration</td><td>Mentor juniors</td><td>Lead initiatives</td><td>Build culture</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Learning-Path-Recommendations"><a href="#Learning-Path-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Learning Path Recommendations"></a>Learning Path Recommendations</h3><p><strong>Years 0-2 (Foundation Building)</strong></p><ul><li>Master core design craft</li><li>Learn basic HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS</li><li>Understand your product’s business model</li><li>Practice presenting work</li></ul><p><strong>Years 3-5 (Stack Expansion)</strong></p><ul><li>Ship production code</li><li>Lead research initiatives</li><li>Own feature strategy</li><li>Build cross-functional relationships</li></ul><p><strong>Years 5-8 (Integration)</strong></p><ul><li>Connect design to business outcomes</li><li>Influence technical architecture</li><li>Define team processes</li><li>Mentor other designers</li></ul><p><strong>Years 8+ (Leadership)</strong></p><ul><li>Shape organizational design culture</li><li>Define multi-year vision</li><li>Build new capabilities</li><li>Scale your impact through others</li></ul><h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Full-stack means connecting, not doing everything</strong> - The value is in bridging gaps between strategy, design, and implementation</p></li><li><p><strong>Depth in one area enables breadth in others</strong> - Strong design fundamentals make technical and strategic skills more impactful</p></li><li><p><strong>Organizations must evolve to leverage these designers</strong> - Traditional structures often constrain full-stack designers’ potential impact</p></li></ol>]]></content>

      <title>The MAP Framework: A New Direction for Product Development</title>
      <link href="/2025/03/17/The-MAP-Framework/"/>
      <url>/2025/03/17/The-MAP-Framework/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In traditional product development, we see a familiar sequence: product managers identify requirements, designers make them usable, and engineers build them. This approach has served us for decades, but increasingly leads to fragmented experiences, costly pivots, and organizational friction. This proposal is my attempt to share what I’ve seen work best in both large and small organizations.</p><h2 id="The-MAP-Framework-Rethinking-Role-Sequencing"><a href="#The-MAP-Framework-Rethinking-Role-Sequencing" class="headerlink" title="The MAP Framework: Rethinking Role Sequencing"></a>The MAP Framework: Rethinking Role Sequencing</h2><p>Imagine your product team as explorers charting new territory. Your customers stand at various points on the landscape, each with distinct needs. Your challenge isn’t just to deliver solutions—it’s to anticipate where those customers will be when your offerings reach them, and provide exactly what they’ll need when they arrive there.</p><p>In this framework, we follow a three-stage process that reorders traditional roles:</p><div class="map-container">  <div class="map-section">    <h3 class="map-heading">M - Mapping <span class="map-leader">(Designers Lead)</span></h3>    <p>      <strong>Designers scout ahead</strong>, researching and mapping what's on the horizon. They create multiple solution options within established business objectives, working alongside technical advisors to ensure feasibility. Instead of reacting to pre-defined requirements, they identify holistic opportunities and explore comprehensive solutions.    </p>  </div>  <div class="map-section">    <h3 class="map-heading">A - Assessing <span class="map-leader">(Product Managers Lead)</span></h3>    <p>      <strong>Product Managers evaluate design options against business metrics and technical complexity</strong>. They determine what gets built when, transforming comprehensive visions into strategic deliverables. Instead of defining requirements upfront, they curate and segment designer-led explorations into viable roadmap components.    </p>  </div>  <div class="map-section">    <h3 class="map-heading">P - Producing <span class="map-leader">(Engineers Lead)</span></h3>    <p>      <strong>Engineers collaborate throughout</strong>, providing technical guidance during exploration and ultimately implementing solutions that deliver reliable value. Their expertise shapes the feasibility of design concepts before commitment, rather than being constrained to implement pre-decided features.    </p>  </div></div><style>.map-container {  display: flex;  flex-direction: column;  gap: 24px;  margin: 36px 0;}.map-section {  border-left: 4px solid hsl(43, 40%, 60%);  padding: 12px 24px;  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);  border-radius: 6px;  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);}.map-heading {  display: flex;  align-items: baseline;  margin-top: 0;  color: hsl(15, 70%, 40%);  font-weight: 700;}.map-leader {  font-weight: 400;  font-style: italic;  margin-left: 6px;  font-size: 0.9em;  color: hsl(35, 15%, 30%);}.map-section p {  margin-bottom: 0;  color: hsl(24, 3%, 35%);}@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {  .map-section {    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);    border-left-color: hsl(43, 40%, 80%);    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);  }    .map-heading {    color: hsl(40, 80%, 50%);  }    .map-leader {    color: hsl(0, 0%, 71%);  }    .map-section p {    color: hsl(0, 0%, 90%);  }}</style><p>While I’ve described these responsibilities aligned with traditional roles, I recognize that in practice, capabilities often cross role boundaries. Many product managers are skilled at design thinking, designers often have strong business acumen, and engineers frequently contribute innovative solutions. The key is ensuring these perspectives are present, regardless of job titles</p><p>This sequencing ensures we understand the complete solution space before committing to implementation paths. The critical shift is moving from “here’s what we’ll build, now make it usable” to “here are comprehensive user needs and potential solutions, now let’s determine what to build.”</p><h2 id="Why-MAP"><a href="#Why-MAP" class="headerlink" title="Why MAP"></a>Why MAP</h2><p>The traditional approach often results in:</p><ul><li><strong>Disjointed experiences</strong>: Features are defined in isolation, leading to inconsistent user journeys</li><li><strong>Solution myopia</strong>: Teams optimize for the first viable solution rather than exploring the solution space</li><li><strong>Design debt</strong>: Compromises made for expedience accumulate, requiring periodic “redesign” projects</li><li><strong>Reactive adjustments</strong>: Post-launch changes to fix problems that could have been identified earlier</li></ul><p>By placing design exploration before roadmap definition, the MAP Framework creates:</p><ul><li><strong>Solution space understanding</strong>: Mapping possibilities before committing to specific implementations</li><li><strong>Coherent vision</strong>: A comprehensive view that ensures features work together naturally</li><li><strong>Anticipatory development</strong>: Building with future needs in mind rather than for immediate requirements</li><li><strong>Reduced waste</strong>: Fewer post-launch adjustments and emergency fixes</li></ul><h2 id="Addressing-Common-Objections"><a href="#Addressing-Common-Objections" class="headerlink" title="Addressing Common Objections"></a>Addressing Common Objections</h2><p>The MAP Framework isn’t without challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>“It will slow us down”</strong>: While the initial Mapping phase requires upfront investment, it typically reduces rework and enables faster execution once direction is set. For urgent market demands, a modified “rapid mapping” approach can compress the process.</li><li><strong>“Our engineers will be idle”</strong>: By involving engineers during Mapping for technical guidance (not implementation), they contribute valuable perspective while documentation and planning work continues in parallel.</li><li><strong>“It’s too theoretical”</strong>: Design exploration should be grounded in user research and technical reality. Rapid prototyping and validation keep the process practical and evidence-based.</li><li><strong>“Our leadership needs precise estimates”</strong>: Clear scope boundaries can be established even during exploration. The approach actually improves estimation by reducing mid-project scope changes.</li></ul><h2 id="Implementation-Considerations"><a href="#Implementation-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Implementation Considerations"></a>Implementation Considerations</h2><p>The MAP Framework requires thoughtful implementation:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Executive alignment</strong>:</p><ul><li>Clear understanding that this is a process change, not just a role change</li><li>Agreement that design exploration has business value before feature commitment</li><li>Willingness to accept initial timeline uncertainty for greater downstream precision</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Team dynamics</strong>:</p><ul><li>Designers comfortable with strategic thinking, not just tactical execution</li><li>Product managers willing to curate rather than dictate</li><li>Engineers engaged early in possibility exploration</li><li>Cross-functional respect that transcends traditional role boundaries</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Process adjustments</strong>:</p><ul><li>Dedicated time for solution Mapping before roadmap commitment</li><li>Technical feasibility checks throughout design exploration</li><li>Clear transition points from Mapping to Assessing to Producing</li><li>Modified processes for genuine emergencies and critical fixes</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Measuring success</strong>:</p><ul><li>Reduction in post-launch design changes and emergency fixes</li><li>Improved adoption and engagement metrics</li><li>Decreased support and training costs</li><li>Team satisfaction and reduced friction in implementation phases</li><li>Consistency in user experience across features and products</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="Charting-Your-Organization’s-Path"><a href="#Charting-Your-Organization’s-Path" class="headerlink" title="Charting Your Organization’s Path"></a>Charting Your Organization’s Path</h2><p>The MAP Framework represents a fundamental rethinking of how we create digital products. By positioning exploratory work at the beginning of the process, we enable teams to develop more thoughtful solutions rather than isolated features. This isn’t merely about changing responsibilities—it’s about transforming how we navigate from customer needs to delivered value.</p><p>Implementation requires honest assessment of your organization’s readiness. There will likely be resistance from those comfortable with traditional processes, and the transition period may temporarily reduce velocity before improving it. Start with a targeted pilot project where the stakes are meaningful but manageable—perhaps a feature overhaul or new product extension. Document both the process differences and outcomes compared to your traditional approach. Share these insights widely, celebrating successes while acknowledging challenges transparently.</p><p>What makes this approach promising is that it doesn’t necessarily require organizational restructuring to begin—it primarily demands a sequencing change and mindset shift. Product teams can adopt the MAP Framework within existing structures while building evidence for broader change.</p><p>The companies that thrive in complex markets are increasingly those that anticipate customer needs rather than just responding to them. By elevating design exploration as the first step in your product development journey, you position your team to see further, understand deeper, and build products that have a better chance of truly resonating with users.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Design-first exploration reduces waste</strong> - By mapping the complete solution space before committing to features, teams avoid costly pivots and create more coherent user experiences</p></li><li><p><strong>Role sequencing matters more than role definitions</strong> - The critical shift is ensuring comprehensive exploration happens before roadmap commitment, regardless of who does what</p></li><li><p><strong>Early technical involvement prevents late surprises</strong> - Engineers contributing during the Mapping phase ensures feasibility without constraining creativity</p></li></ol><h2 id="Resources"><a href="#Resources" class="headerlink" title="Resources"></a>Resources</h2><p>Ready to implement the MAP Framework?

Companies like Linear, Vercel, and Railway are building entire teams of designer-developers who own features from concept to deployment.</p><p>Why? Because handoffs are expensive. Every translation between design and development is an opportunity for misunderstanding, delay, and compromise. When one person can carry an idea from sketch to production, magic happens.</p><h2 id="Why-Code-Makes-You-a-Better-Designer"><a href="#Why-Code-Makes-You-a-Better-Designer" class="headerlink" title="Why Code Makes You a Better Designer"></a>Why Code Makes You a Better Designer</h2><p>Understanding how your designs translate to code makes you a better designer. Period. You:</p><ul><li><strong>Spot technical constraints earlier</strong> (saving weeks of wasted exploration)</li><li><strong>Design with performance in mind</strong> (60fps animations vs. slideshow jank)</li><li><strong>Make smarter interaction decisions</strong> (knowing what’s easy vs. what’s painful)</li><li><strong>Speak the language developers respect</strong> (earning credibility and influence)</li></ul><p>But here’s the real secret: coding knowledge makes you more creative, not less.

If you can design systematically, you can code.</p><p><strong>“It will make me worse at visual design”</strong><br>The opposite. Constraints breed creativity. Plus, you’ll finally understand why developers “can’t just make it pixel-perfect.”</p><p><strong>“AI will replace developer jobs”</strong><br>AI amplifies both designers and developers. Designer-developers who use AI are unstoppable. Those who don’t are replaceable.</p><p><strong>“I don’t have time”</strong><br>You don’t have time NOT to.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Challenge"><a href="#The-Challenge" class="headerlink" title="The Challenge"></a>The Challenge</h2><p>As smartphones have grown larger and more powerful, they’ve become increasingly difficult to use with one hand. The average screen size has ballooned from 3.5 inches to over 6 inches, yet our thumbs haven’t grown to match. This creates a fundamental usability problem: the very devices designed to be mobile and convenient now require two hands for basic navigation.</p><p>The current solutions—reachability modes, one-handed keyboards, and floating buttons—feel like band-aids on a broken paradigm. They acknowledge the problem but don’t fundamentally rethink how we interact with large screens.</p><h2 id="The-Monophone-Concept"><a href="#The-Monophone-Concept" class="headerlink" title="The Monophone Concept"></a>The Monophone Concept</h2><p>Monophone reimagines mobile navigation from first principles, treating the thumb’s natural arc as the primary design constraint. Instead of forcing users to reach across vast screen real estate, the interface comes to them.</p><h3 id="Core-Principles"><a href="#Core-Principles" class="headerlink" title="Core Principles"></a>Core Principles</h3><ol><li><strong>Thumb-First Design</strong>: Every interactive element lives within the comfortable reach of an average thumb</li><li><strong>Gestural Navigation</strong>: Swipes and taps replace distant buttons</li><li><strong>Contextual Adaptation</strong>: The UI reshapes based on grip and usage patterns</li><li><strong>Progressive Disclosure</strong>: Information appears as needed, within the thumb zone</li></ol><h3 id="Key-Features"><a href="#Key-Features" class="headerlink" title="Key Features"></a>Key Features</h3><p>The concept introduces several innovative interaction patterns:</p><ul><li><strong>Arc Menu</strong>: A radial menu that appears at the thumb’s resting position</li><li><strong>Gesture Shortcuts</strong>: Customizable swipe patterns for common actions</li><li><strong>Gravity Wells</strong>: UI elements that subtly pull toward the thumb’s position</li><li><strong>Haptic Guides</strong>: Vibration feedback that confirms gesture recognition</li></ul><h2 id="Technical-Implementation"><a href="#Technical-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Technical Implementation"></a>Technical Implementation</h2><p>The demo is built as a React web application that showcases the core interaction concepts. It uses:</p><ul><li><strong>Framer Motion</strong> for fluid, physics-based animations</li><li><strong>Touch gesture recognition</strong> for natural swipe interactions</li><li><strong>Responsive design</strong> that adapts to different device sizes and orientations</li><li><strong>Haptic feedback</strong> via the Vibration API (where supported)</li></ul><h2 id="Design-Process"><a href="#Design-Process" class="headerlink" title="Design Process"></a>Design Process</h2><p>The project began with extensive research into hand anthropometry and grip patterns. By studying how people naturally hold their phones—on trains, while walking, in bed—clear patterns emerged about comfortable and uncomfortable reach zones.</p><p>Prototyping started with paper mockups to quickly test gesture ideas, then moved to interactive prototypes to refine the timing and feel of animations. The goal was to make every interaction feel as natural as using a physical tool.</p><h2 id="Future-Directions"><a href="#Future-Directions" class="headerlink" title="Future Directions"></a>Future Directions</h2><p>While this concept demo focuses on navigation, the principles could extend to:</p><ul><li><strong>Text input</strong>: Reimagined keyboards that follow the thumb arc</li><li><strong>Content consumption</strong>: Reading and scrolling optimized for one hand</li><li><strong>Gaming</strong>: Controls that never require hand repositioning</li><li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Adaptive interfaces for users with different hand mobility</li></ul><p>The monophone concept isn’t just about making phones easier to use—it’s about designing technology that adapts to human limitations rather than forcing humans to adapt to technology.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Costco: Amazon v2?</title>
      <link href="/2024/11/17/costco-amazon-v2/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Costco has long been the king of bulk buying and private-label loyalty. Its warehouses, stocked with pallets of everything from giant bags of coffee beans to surprisingly great Kirkland-brand dress shirts, have earned it an incredibly loyal membership base. But in the age of e-commerce, does Costco have what it takes to evolve into something like an Amazon competitor?</p><p>At first glance, it seems like Costco is lagging. Their online experience is limited, and their digital strategy feels more “1999 catalog” than “Prime ecosystem.” But what if their perceived disadvantage is actually their hidden strength?</p><p>Here’s the case: Costco doesn’t need to be Amazon. It has something Amazon didn’t have when it started—established trust and a vast network of strategically located brick-and-mortar stores. Imagine Costco leveraging its physical footprint as a hybrid e-commerce hub. Each warehouse becomes a distribution center, cutting down on last-mile delivery costs while giving members the option of same-day in-store pickup or returns.</p><p>And then there’s the Kirkland Signature brand—arguably one of the most trusted private labels in the world. From olive oil to down jackets, Kirkland could dominate categories online in a way that generic third-party sellers on Amazon simply can’t.</p><p>The real advantage, though, is timing. By coming late to the e-commerce game, Costco can learn from Amazon’s early missteps. No need to waste billions experimenting with low-margin, third-party marketplaces or drone delivery—Costco can zero in on what works. A streamlined, membership-focused e-commerce experience that stays true to its value-first philosophy might be all it needs to carve out a niche.</p><p>Amazon thrives on ubiquity, while Costco thrives on scarcity—you go there because it has just enough of what you need, at prices you can’t resist. The challenge is building an online experience that retains the same sense of discovery and value while leveraging the logistics lessons Amazon has already learned.</p><p>Costco might not be Amazon 2.0, but it doesn’t have to be. It can be Costco 2.0—and that might just be enough to shift the game.</p><hr><p><em>P.S. I’ve been sick this past week, and have been relying on Amazon for basics. But I also hate the idea of giving Bezos any more money <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/jeff-bezos-penis-shaped-rocket-144010824.html">for his penis rockets</a> so here we are.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s current approach to fullscreen apps often leaves users with a fragmented experience, especially when new windows are involved. It’s almost like that ‘forgetting why I entered the room’ effect—each time you’re forced to switch between spaces, it disrupts your focus and makes it harder to stay on task.</p><p>A more cohesive approach would be for the OS to support functionality that keeps new windows within the same fullscreen space. For instance, imagine an option to open new windows in a side panel, modal, or integrated split view within the existing fullscreen environment. The specifics aren’t as important as the need for a smoother, more intuitive way to manage windows in fullscreen mode. A redesigned experience like this would allow for better task continuity and a more productive workflow overall.</p>]]></content>

And just when you think you’re in the clear—you realize you have to undo the mistake and endure all those loading delays again.</p><p>Assuming, of course, you don’t get so frustrated that you repeat the entire ordeal thanks to that maddening interface.</p>]]></content>

Assigning a more senior designer can provide the expertise required. A skilled designer effectively manages large projects by prioritizing tasks and leveraging efficient workflows. They collaborate with team members for support in non-design areas, ensuring the project stays on track.</p></li><li><p><strong>What about the benefits of peer review and critique among designers?</strong><br>While peer review can enhance a project’s quality, it doesn’t necessarily require multiple designers working on the same project simultaneously. A single designer can still engage in peer reviews by presenting their work to other designers not directly involved in the project. This approach maintains the integrity of the singular vision while benefiting from constructive feedback. Additionally, design critiques can be scheduled at key milestones, allowing the designer to refine their work based on expert insights without fragmenting the design process.</p></li><li><p><strong>What about bias? Oversight?</strong><br>To address potential bias and oversight, a competent designer engages in continuous feedback loops with users, clients, and team members. They conduct user research and usability testing to uncover blind spots and ensure the design is inclusive and effective. This proactive approach leads to a well-rounded product that meets the needs of all stakeholders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Isn’t specialization important in complex projects requiring diverse design skills?</strong><br>Complex projects often require a range of design skills, such as user experience (UX), user interface (UI), graphic design, and interaction design. A competent designer usually has a broad skill set and can handle multiple aspects of design. However, when specialized expertise is necessary, the lead designer can collaborate with specialists in those areas. This collaboration doesn’t dilute the singular design vision but rather enriches it by incorporating specialized knowledge into a cohesive whole.</p></li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s strategy to bridge the gap by porting iOS games to macOS isn’t just clever; it’s a smart way to boost the perceived value of Macs. From a customer’s perspective, the main difference between platforms is how you interact with them. Younger generations are already comfortable doing “serious” work on mobile devices, while older generations still view computers as essential for such tasks.</p><p>Personally, I envision a future where a single “instance” lives in the cloud, connecting all our devices. This instance would adapt to the strengths and constraints of whatever hardware we’re using. Imagine a world where all your devices could be off, but processes continue to run in the cloud, managing errands, scheduling, and correspondence autonomously. This vision underscores the importance of seamless integration and cross-compatibility, making Apple’s approach of leveraging iOS apps for macOS a step in the right direction.</p><p>But the true potential lies beyond merely porting apps; it’s about creating a unified ecosystem where work and play can move fluidly across devices. Apple’s ecosystem is already tightly integrated, but taking it a step further to a cloud-based instance would revolutionize how we interact with technology. This means no matter what device you’re using—be it an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or even Apple Watch—you could pick up exactly where you left off, with all your data, apps, and workflows perfectly synchronized and optimized for the device at hand.</p><p>Such seamless, cloud-based integration would bring several benefits:</p><p><strong>Efficiency and Convenience:</strong> Tasks like managing emails, scheduling, and even complex workflows could continue uninterrupted, regardless of which device you switch to. This would be particularly useful for professionals who move between devices throughout their day.</p><p><strong>Resource Optimization:</strong> A cloud instance could dynamically allocate resources based on the device’s capabilities, ensuring that power-hungry tasks are handled by more robust devices, while simpler tasks can be managed by smaller, portable devices.</p><p><strong>Sustainability:</strong> By relying on a centralized cloud instance, individual devices could be more energy-efficient, as they wouldn’t need to constantly handle heavy processing tasks. This could extend battery life and reduce overall power consumption.</p><p><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> The user experience would be significantly improved, with a consistent interface and seamless transition between devices. This would make the Apple ecosystem even more attractive to users who value both productivity and ease of use.</p><p>For this vision to become a reality, Apple would need to invest in robust cloud infrastructure and advanced AI to manage these instances efficiently. They would also need to ensure strong security measures are in place to protect user data as it moves between devices. This should be seen as a stepping stone towards a more ambitious goal: a unified, cloud-based platform that truly harnesses the power of Apple’s ecosystem. This strategy could redefine how we interact with our devices, making technology more intuitive, efficient, and integrated than ever before.</p>]]></content>

      <link href="/2024/06/01/Overlay/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Problem-Isolated-Product-Silos"><a href="#The-Problem-Isolated-Product-Silos" class="headerlink" title="The Problem: Isolated Product Silos"></a>The Problem: Isolated Product Silos</h2><p>Autodesk’s array of desktop products operated as completely isolated silos. Users lost context switching between applications, couldn’t access shared functionality across their workflows, and had to relearn basic tasks in every product. Meanwhile, engineering teams rebuilt identical features dozens of times—smart assistance in one product remained trapped there while users struggled with the same problems in adjacent tools.</p><h2 id="Solution-Cross-Application-Intelligence-Platform"><a href="#Solution-Cross-Application-Intelligence-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Solution: Cross-Application Intelligence Platform"></a>Solution: Cross-Application Intelligence Platform</h2><p>I designed and prototyped a universal overlay system that would run as a cloud-connected singleton across all Autodesk desktop applications. Like Steam’s overlay for gaming, this concept creates a persistent application layer that follows users everywhere—enabling shared functionality, contextual assistance, and seamless workflows while maintaining bidirectional communication with host applications.</p><div class="video-container">  <video controls playsinline style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 24px 0;" autoplay loop muted>        <source src="overlayExplainer_web.webm" type="video/webm">    <source src="overlayExplainer_web.mp4" type="video/mp4">    Your browser does not support the video tag.  </video></div><p>The Overlay concept represented a fundamental shift in how Autodesk could approach desktop software architecture. Rather than maintaining isolated applications, I designed a shared platform layer that could enhance any desktop product with cloud-connected capabilities.</p><h2 id="Technical-Design-Prototyping"><a href="#Technical-Design-Prototyping" class="headerlink" title="Technical Design &amp; Prototyping"></a>Technical Design &amp; Prototyping</h2><p>Working closely with engineering teams across the organization, I designed a React-based overlay architecture that could theoretically integrate with native desktop applications. The conceptual system uses a singleton pattern to maintain state across applications while respecting each product’s unique interface requirements.</p><p>The architecture featured several breakthrough innovations:</p><ul><li><strong>Universal React Architecture:</strong> A conceptual single codebase that could deploy components across different desktop applications with native-feeling integration</li><li><strong>Persistent Cloud State:</strong> Designed system for user context, preferences, and work history to synchronize across entire product ecosystem in real-time</li><li><strong>Bidirectional Communication:</strong> Architected overlay to read application state, trigger host actions, and respond to application events seamlessly</li><li><strong>Contextual Intelligence Engine:</strong> Designed system to understand current user tasks and proactively surface relevant tools, shortcuts, and guidance</li><li><strong>Adaptive Integration:</strong> Designed overlay to respect each product’s unique interface language while maintaining consistent core functionality</li></ul><p>The proposed overlay would communicate bidirectionally with host applications through a standardized API, allowing it to both read application state and trigger native actions. This design approach creates experiences that would feel truly integrated rather than bolted-on.</p><h2 id="Envisioned-User-Experience-Impact"><a href="#Envisioned-User-Experience-Impact" class="headerlink" title="Envisioned User Experience Impact"></a>Envisioned User Experience Impact</h2><p>The concept’s most significant potential was eliminating context loss between applications. Users would access their project history, smart suggestions, and collaborative tools from any Autodesk desktop product, transforming fragmented workflows into cohesive experiences.</p><p>The designed contextual intelligence engine would analyze user behavior patterns to proactively surface relevant tools and guidance. Instead of forcing users to remember different workflows across products, the overlay would adapt to their current task and provide consistent assistance.</p><h2 id="Project-Impact-Executive-Vision"><a href="#Project-Impact-Executive-Vision" class="headerlink" title="Project Impact &amp; Executive Vision"></a>Project Impact &amp; Executive Vision</h2><p>The Overlay initiative secured VP-level sponsorship and achieved critical milestones:</p><ul><li><strong>Executive Buy-in</strong>: Presented directly to VP of Platform, securing funding and resources for POC development</li><li><strong>Production-Ready POC</strong>: Delivered fully functional prototype demonstrating cross-application intelligence</li><li><strong>Architectural Innovation</strong>: Designed framework serving 60+ desktop applications with single codebase</li><li><strong>$10M+ Savings Potential</strong>: Identified duplicate feature development across teams that platform would eliminate</li></ul><p>The project successfully reached production-ready POC stage with demonstrated ROI and technical feasibility. Following a strategic reorganization, the company pivoted to an alternative implementation approach. The foundational architecture and design principles I established continue to influence Autodesk’s platform strategy.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As far as I’ve seen, most of these smart assistant devices that have been coming out can’t answer a pretty obvious question– why can’t this just be an app?</p><p>Seriously, I don’t know anyone who is going to want to carry <em>another</em> device around to capture this functionality, and the tradeoffs in functionality you lose from not having your phone (as fancy and sleek as some of these devices look) make you worse off. All of these demoes rely <strong>heavily</strong> on everything working out correctly, and you going along with what the assistant is saying it’s doing. You know what you’re going to want when something isn’t working? A large screen with direct input on the algo &#x2F; AI that’s running the task (oh hey, like a phone!).</p><p>Paradoxically, the form factor is also the limiting factor for using a phone as one of these smart devices (size, weight, portability). So instead of an entirely new device, why not an accessary that takes all the strengths of a assistant-focused device and pair it to the phone as the processor?</p><p>The capture device (probably a combination camera, microphone, and minimal interactive interface) can be much lighter since they don’t need to handle processing on-device, and can probably be even more minimalistic since you you can offload secondary interactions to the phone.</p><p>Basically what I’m imagining is a revamp of the old iSight: a camera, microphone, and (now) interaction interface that is paired to your phone and serves as your assistant’s eyes into your context. Something like this:</p><p><img src="/2024/04/16/turning-the-phone-into-companion-ai-with-iSight/newSight.jpeg"></p>]]></content>

Normal cars need to be washed and cleaned regularly. But, what makes the Cybertruck more unique than other vehicles on the road is that its body doesn’t have a clear coat. <strong>That means that any corrosive substances that come in contact with the body have to be cleaned immediately or they’ll heavily damage the stainless steel body.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Sounds like fun.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>Autodesk’s smart guidance system could detect when users needed help and deliver contextual tutorials—but only if engineering teams had time to publish them. Our behavioral monitoring showed users struggling with features that generated $6-8M in annual revenue, yet the guidance to help them took 3-4 weeks to publish.</p><p>The process was absurd: content creators would identify user problems, write solutions, then wait for engineering sprints to code their tutorials into the product. Sarah, a content designer, captured the frustration perfectly: “I can see exactly what users need help with, but by the time we publish the solution, they’ve already given up.”</p><p>The business impact was severe:</p><ul><li><strong>15% suppression</strong> of Fusion trial-to-paid conversion, leaving $6-8M ARR on the table</li><li><strong>$2M annually</strong> in engineering time spent on manual publishing tasks</li><li><strong>3-6 week delays</strong> for new feature guides, stalling adoption at 60%</li><li><strong>10-point NPS drop</strong> when users encountered outdated content</li></ul><h2 id="Research-Discovery"><a href="#Research-Discovery" class="headerlink" title="Research &amp; Discovery"></a>Research &amp; Discovery</h2><p>I mapped the complete content lifecycle and discovered it took eight people across four teams to publish a single guidance tip. The revelation: we were treating every tutorial like a software feature, complete with wiki documentation, engineering tickets, and QA cycles.</p><p><strong>Stakeholder Interviews:</strong> Content creators revealed they were compromising quality due to process friction. James, a senior strategist, explained: “We write one generic tutorial that sort of helps everyone instead of three targeted ones that perfectly help different user types.”</p><p><strong>Technical Audit:</strong> Our platform could already handle dynamic content and behavioral targeting. The bottleneck wasn’t capability—it was accessibility. The publishing interface required engineering knowledge that content experts didn’t have (and shouldn’t need).</p><p><strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> I tested a simplified flow with five content creators.

Content creators needed professional capabilities delivered through consumer-grade experiences. The challenge wasn’t simplifying their work but removing the technical barriers that prevented them from doing their best work.</p><p>The visual approach to behavioral targeting exceeded expectations. Rather than dumbing down the logic, the drag-and-drop interface actually made more sophisticated targeting accessible to people who understood user behavior better than engineers ever could.</p><p>Looking back, I wish I’d involved the engineering team earlier in the design process. While the final solution eliminated their publishing burden, earlier collaboration might have revealed additional automation opportunities.</p><p>The key learning: the best tools amplify human expertise rather than replacing it. Content creators didn’t need AI to write their guidance—they needed technology to get out of their way so they could solve user problems as quickly as they could identify them. By removing process friction, we didn’t just save time and money—we fundamentally changed how quickly Autodesk could respond to user needs.</p>]]></content>

Inconsistent Component Heights"></a>1. Inconsistent Component Heights</h3><p>Look at those form fields—each one seems to have decided its own height. This isn’t just aesthetically painful; it breaks the fundamental principle of visual rhythm. When elements don’t align to a consistent grid, users subconsciously feel that something is “off.”</p><p><strong>The fix</strong>: Establish a base unit (usually 8px) and ensure all components are multiples of this unit.</p><h3 id="2-Padding-Chaos"><a href="#2-Padding-Chaos" class="headerlink" title="2. Padding Chaos"></a>2. Padding Chaos</h3><p>The padding between elements looks like it was determined by a random number generator. Some elements are cramped, others have oceans of space. This destroys visual hierarchy and makes the interface feel unbalanced.</p><p><strong>The fix</strong>: Define consistent spacing tokens (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, etc.) and use them religiously.</p><h3 id="3-Button-Style-Buffet"><a href="#3-Button-Style-Buffet" class="headerlink" title="3. Button Style Buffet"></a>3. Button Style Buffet</h3><p>We’ve got what appears to be at least three different button treatments in the same view. Primary, secondary, tertiary? No—just confusion. This forces users to decode which actions are important rather than intuitively understanding hierarchy.</p><p><strong>The fix</strong>: Limit button variations to 3-4 well-defined types with clear use cases.</p><h3 id="4-Label-Control-Relationships"><a href="#4-Label-Control-Relationships" class="headerlink" title="4. Label-Control Relationships"></a>4. Label-Control Relationships</h3><p>The spacing between labels and their associated controls is inconsistent, making it unclear which label belongs to which input. This is accessibility 101, folks.</p><p><strong>The fix</strong>: Labels should be closer to their controls than to other elements (law of proximity).</p><h2 id="Why-This-Happens-in-Enterprise"><a href="#Why-This-Happens-in-Enterprise" class="headerlink" title="Why This Happens in Enterprise"></a>Why This Happens in Enterprise</h2><p>This isn’t random incompetence. Enterprise design fails for systemic reasons:</p><p><strong>Legacy accumulation</strong>: Different teams add features over years without coordination<br><strong>Design system immaturity</strong>: No central authority enforcing consistency<br><strong>Engineering-led UI</strong>: Developers making visual decisions without design input<br><strong>Acquisition integration</strong>: Bolting together products from different companies<br><strong>“Good enough” culture</strong>: Shipping functionality over experience</p><h2 id="Lessons-for-Your-Design-System"><a href="#Lessons-for-Your-Design-System" class="headerlink" title="Lessons for Your Design System"></a>Lessons for Your Design System</h2><h3 id="1-Document-Everything"><a href="#1-Document-Everything" class="headerlink" title="1. Document Everything"></a>1. Document Everything</h3><p>If it’s not documented, it doesn’t exist. Every spacing value, every color, every component state needs to be in your design system.</p><h3 id="2-Enforce-Through-Code"><a href="#2-Enforce-Through-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. Enforce Through Code"></a>2. Enforce Through Code</h3><p>Design systems fail when they’re just Figma files. Build your system into your component library so developers can’t accidentally break it.</p><h3 id="3-Regular-Audits"><a href="#3-Regular-Audits" class="headerlink" title="3. Regular Audits"></a>3. Regular Audits</h3><p>Schedule quarterly “consistency audits” where you screenshot your entire product and look for drift. Fix it before it compounds.</p><h3 id="4-Empower-Developers"><a href="#4-Empower-Developers" class="headerlink" title="4. Empower Developers"></a>4. Empower Developers</h3><p>Most developers want to build good UIs—they just need the tools. Provide clear tokens, components, and examples.</p><h3 id="5-Make-the-Right-Thing-Easy"><a href="#5-Make-the-Right-Thing-Easy" class="headerlink" title="5. Make the Right Thing Easy"></a>5. Make the Right Thing Easy</h3><p>If using the design system is harder than not using it, people won’t use it. Your components should be the path of least resistance.</p><h2 id="The-Real-Cost"><a href="#The-Real-Cost" class="headerlink" title="The Real Cost"></a>The Real Cost</h2><p>This isn’t just about aesthetics. Inconsistent UI:</p><ul><li>Increases cognitive load</li><li>Reduces trust in the product</li><li>Slows down development (every element is custom)</li><li>Makes onboarding harder</li><li>Leads to more support tickets</li></ul><p>Microsoft has the resources to fix this. The question is whether they have the will.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Consistency is a feature</strong>—Users shouldn’t have to relearn your UI on every screen</p></li><li><p><strong>Design systems are insurance</strong>—Pay the premium upfront or pay the claims forever</p></li><li><p><strong>Details matter at scale</strong>—Small inconsistencies multiply into big problems</p></li></ol><p>When you see UI this broken from a company Microsoft’s size, it’s not a design problem—it’s an organizational problem.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently finished reading <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-state-of-ux-in-2024-enter-late-stage-ux-e9b403b67667">The State of UX in 2024: Enter late-stage UX</a>, and had a few thoughts:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Automation</strong><br>AI automates an increasing part of our jobs and reduces demand for designers in certain markets.</p></blockquote><p>This evolution has been a long time in the making. Hard skills, traditionally deemed future-proof, are now facing challenges. The current opportunity lies in designers embracing AI-driven design generation to facilitate faster iterations and expedite the turnaround of concepts.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Saturation</strong><br>Supply of designers outstrips demand. Market is still uncertain.</p></blockquote><p>This was evident even in the early 2010s when the market was saturated with “designers” from bootcamps who made negligible contributions to the industry at large.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Commoditization</strong><br>Focus on scalability and standardization over differentiation and delight.</p></blockquote><p>Much like the industrialization of physical products, it is only logical that the next evolutionary step in digital design involves seeking ways to componentize and streamline the overall process. While there is still value in craftsmanship, (particularly when users anticipate a premium experience) the majority of products are utilitarian in nature and do not necessarily benefit from overly crafted experiences.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Financialization</strong><br>Greater influence of financial health, shareholders interests, and business metrics in design decisions.</p></blockquote><p>First and foremost you are a designer, not an artist; you are hired to solve business problems through design.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Disintegration</strong><br>Lack of trust in digital products makes users either skeptical, complacent, or susceptible to exploitation.</p></blockquote><p>An industry that heavily relied on dark patterns and manipulation to maintain user engagement results in a lack of trust? What a surprise.</p>]]></content>

But, yes, I think the event was 100% “this could have been an email” territory.</p><p><strong>The iPhone and Apple Watch incremental updates absolutely should have been a Newsroom press release.</strong><br>Sending out announcements and building up expectations only to not deliver to those expectations erodes the positive sentiment people have generated towards Apple announcement events. If you do that too many times, nobody will take them seriously anymore.</p><p><strong>The carbon neutral achievements are impressive, but they would have been better utilized in an ad campaign.</strong><br>Average consumers don’t watch these keynotes. Sure, they get trickle-down information of what Apple released eventually, but you know what people <em>do</em> pay attention to? Apple ads. They have a very distinct style and are (almost) always effective at communicating the benefits of Apple product releases. If anything, having an ad campaign that Apple have revamped the materials of most of their accessories is compelling to get people into stores simple to see (and more importantly) touch the new materials.</p><blockquote><p>Today’s Apple event might have been the first time I didn’t actively watch or follow the updates. When I went back to check what had been announced, I saw that there was nothing of particular significance.

      <title>Over-meeting is bad for design</title>

      <url>/2023/06/21/Over-meeting-is-bad-for-design/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over-meeting days are pretty much shit for design productivity. What makes it particularly frustrating is that there isn’t automatically additional time given to complete the actual designs. This is why designers often end up having to resort to the simplest solution: they simply haven’t had enough time to properly process the problem and try an adequate number of solutions.</p><h2 id="The-Hidden-Cost-of-Context-Switching"><a href="#The-Hidden-Cost-of-Context-Switching" class="headerlink" title="The Hidden Cost of Context Switching"></a>The Hidden Cost of Context Switching</h2><p>Design isn’t like email. You can’t do it in 15-minute chunks between meetings. Every time you’re pulled out of design work, you lose:</p><ul><li><strong>20-30 minutes</strong> getting back into flow state</li><li><strong>Context</strong> about the problem you were solving</li><li><strong>Momentum</strong> on exploring creative solutions</li><li><strong>Energy</strong> from constant context switching</li></ul><p>A day with four one-hour meetings isn’t four hours of meetings—it’s a day with no meaningful design work.</p><h2 id="Why-Design-Needs-Deep-Work"><a href="#Why-Design-Needs-Deep-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Design Needs Deep Work"></a>Why Design Needs Deep Work</h2><p>Good design requires what Cal Newport calls “deep work”—cognitively demanding activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration. Here’s what happens in uninterrupted design time:</p><p><strong>0-20 minutes</strong>: Getting into the problem space, reviewing context<br><strong>20-45 minutes</strong>: Initial explorations, obvious solutions<br><strong>45-90 minutes</strong>: Breakthrough thinking, non-obvious connections<br><strong>90+ minutes</strong>: Refinement, systematic exploration of variations</p><p>When you only have 30-minute blocks, you never get past the obvious.</p><h2 id="The-Meeting-Industrial-Complex"><a href="#The-Meeting-Industrial-Complex" class="headerlink" title="The Meeting Industrial Complex"></a>The Meeting Industrial Complex</h2><p>How did we get here? The proliferation of meetings often masks deeper organizational issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Lack of clear ownership</strong> → More stakeholder check-ins</li><li><strong>Poor documentation</strong> → Verbal updates instead of written</li><li><strong>Risk aversion</strong> → Consensus-building theater</li><li><strong>Visibility anxiety</strong> → Performative collaboration</li></ul><p>The irony: the more meetings we have about the design, the worse the design gets.</p><h2 id="Protecting-Design-Time-Practical-Strategies"><a href="#Protecting-Design-Time-Practical-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="Protecting Design Time: Practical Strategies"></a>Protecting Design Time: Practical Strategies</h2><h3 id="For-Designers"><a href="#For-Designers" class="headerlink" title="For Designers"></a>For Designers</h3><p><strong>Block your calendar aggressively</strong>. Create recurring “Design Time” blocks of at least 3 hours. Treat them as unmovable as client meetings.</p><p><strong>Batch similar meetings</strong>. Push all reviews to Tuesdays&#x2F;Thursdays. Keep Monday&#x2F;Wednesday&#x2F;Friday clear for deep work.</p><p><strong>Set office hours</strong>. “I’m available for quick questions 2-3pm daily. Otherwise, please Slack.”</p><p><strong>Document proactively</strong>. A well-written Loom or design doc prevents three “catch-up” meetings.</p><h3 id="For-Design-Managers"><a href="#For-Design-Managers" class="headerlink" title="For Design Managers"></a>For Design Managers</h3><p><strong>Implement “No Meeting Wednesdays”</strong>. Give the entire team one guaranteed day of focus.</p><p><strong>Question every recurring meeting</strong>. Could this be an email? A Slack update? Nothing at all?</p><p><strong>Protect your team fiercely</strong>. Your job is to be the shit umbrella, not the shit funnel.</p><p><strong>Measure maker time</strong>. Track how many hours of uninterrupted time designers actually get. Make it a KPI.</p><h3 id="For-Organizations"><a href="#For-Organizations" class="headerlink" title="For Organizations"></a>For Organizations</h3><p><strong>Default to async</strong>. Most “urgent” meetings aren’t. Use tools like Loom, Figma comments, and written updates.</p><p><strong>Shorter meetings by default</strong>. Change your calendar default from 60 to 45 minutes. Use the saved time for deep work.</p><p><strong>Meeting budgets</strong>. Give teams a weekly “meeting hour budget.” Once it’s spent, no more meetings.</p><h2 id="The-Quality-Equation"><a href="#The-Quality-Equation" class="headerlink" title="The Quality Equation"></a>The Quality Equation</h2><p>Here’s the uncomfortable truth: </p><p><strong>Design Quality &#x3D; (Talent × Time²) &#x2F; Interruptions</strong></p><p>Time is quadratic because design solutions build on each other. The fourth hour of uninterrupted work is exponentially more valuable than four separate hours.</p><h2 id="Real-Talk-for-Stakeholders"><a href="#Real-Talk-for-Stakeholders" class="headerlink" title="Real Talk for Stakeholders"></a>Real Talk for Stakeholders</h2><p>If you’re frustrated with design output, look at your designers’ calendars. I guarantee they’re frustrated too. Every meeting you add is a design solution that won’t be explored, a detail that won’t be refined, an innovation that won’t happen.</p><p>Want better design? Give designers time to design.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Design thinking isn’t linear</strong>—it needs uninterrupted time to develop beyond obvious solutions</p></li><li><p><strong>Meeting fragmentation is a quality killer</strong>—four hours of meetings destroys eight hours of productivity</p></li><li><p><strong>Protect maker time like a resource</strong>—because it is one, and it’s scarce</p></li></ol><p>The best design happens in the spaces between meetings. Make sure those spaces exist.</p>]]></content>

I don’t look at Satya Nadella and think of a man who has taste. And Microsoft doesn’t have a Chief Design Officer, as far as I know.</p><p>Instead, Microsoft has VPs. So there’s no one person at the helm saying, “This is the vision and where we’re heading.”</p><p>As a result, I suspect there are actual good designers at Microsoft trying to start movements from within, and those have bubbled up to what we see today as the progression of Microsoft’s design through Fluent from Metro and prior.</p><p>But because there’s no one at the helm, these efforts will always be isolated.</p><p>There will never be anyone saying, “Let’s carry these efforts across products and down to the UI.” “Let’s deprecate and discontinue all of these fragmented UI frameworks. Moving forward, Microsoft will only create UI using Fluent UI.”</p><p>Worse yet, even if someone tried, Microsoft has tried and failed again and again and again so why would you bother?

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As anyone who has worked in tech knows, Minimum Viable Product (MVP) solutions are <em>the</em> popular approach for launching new products. But after a decade in the industry, I think that releasing products in an MVP state to your customers is generally a mistake.</p><h2 id="The-Hidden-Cost-of-“Viable”"><a href="#The-Hidden-Cost-of-“Viable”" class="headerlink" title="The Hidden Cost of “Viable”"></a>The Hidden Cost of “Viable”</h2><p>No customer wants to feel like they’re paying to use something incomplete. When Google launched Gmail, it wasn’t an MVP—it was a polished product with 1GB of storage when competitors offered 2-15MB. When Apple released the iPhone, it wasn’t minimal—it redefined what a phone could be.</p><p>Contrast this with products that launched too early: Google Wave confused users with incomplete features. Color burned through $41 million because their MVP didn’t make sense to anyone. Quibi’s “quick bites” felt like a half-baked concept that no one asked for.</p><h2 id="The-MVP-Trap"><a href="#The-MVP-Trap" class="headerlink" title="The MVP Trap"></a>The MVP Trap</h2><p>The problem isn’t the concept of starting small—it’s what we’ve let MVP become:</p><ul><li><strong>Excuse for shipping broken features</strong> (“We’ll fix it later”)</li><li><strong>Justification for poor UX</strong> (“Users will figure it out”)</li><li><strong>Cover for lack of vision</strong> (“We’ll see what sticks”)</li></ul><p>Your first impression isn’t just about features. It’s about trust. When Spotify launched, it had a limited catalog but the experience was flawless. When Slack entered a crowded market, it wasn’t minimal—it was delightful.</p><h2 id="A-Better-Approach-The-Complete-Experience"><a href="#A-Better-Approach-The-Complete-Experience" class="headerlink" title="A Better Approach: The Complete Experience"></a>A Better Approach: The Complete Experience</h2><p>Instead of Minimum Viable Product, think <strong>Minimum Delightful Experience</strong>:</p><p><strong>Focus relentlessly</strong>: Ship one thing that works perfectly rather than five things that sort of work. Instagram started as just photo sharing—but it was the best photo sharing experience available.</p><p><strong>Polish what you ship</strong>: Your limited feature set should feel intentional, not incomplete. Basecamp has famously kept their product simple, but every feature feels thoughtfully complete.</p><p><strong>Set expectations clearly</strong>: If you’re in beta, act like it. Don’t charge full price for half a product.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/super-mario-bros-movie-1-billion-box-office-milestone-1235598832/">via Variety:</a></p><blockquote><p>As of Sunday, after 26 days of release, the animated video game adaptation, from Universal, Illumination and Nintendo, has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationallly. It’s only the fifth movie of pandemic times to join the $1 billion club, following “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Jurassic World Dominion” and “Avatar: The Way of Water.”</p></blockquote><p>It is always remarkable reading through the reviews of films like this: super mid reviews, talk of plot holes, etc., yet they still manage to draw crowds in.</p><p>This disconnect between online noise and reality has really stopped being surprising at this point. You can see the same thing happen with major yearly releases of video games (Madden, FIFA, Call of Duty), where the reviewers will point out how the game is more of the same, does nothing special, isn’t worth the money, and yet those are always the top grossing games every year.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Design Systems: Expectations &amp; Realities</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Standardizing-designs"><a href="#Standardizing-designs" class="headerlink" title="Standardizing designs"></a>Standardizing designs</h2><p>To begin, let’s align on what exactly we’re talking about when we say “design system”:</p><p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-systems-101/">via Nielsen Norman Group:</a></p><blockquote><p>A design system is a set of standards to manage design at scale by reducing redundancy while creating a shared language and visual consistency across different pages and channels.</p></blockquote><p>Contrast this with the more traditional approach, “human interface guidelines”:</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_guidelines">via Wikipedia:</a></p><blockquote><p>Human interface guidelines (HIG) are software development documents which offer application developers a set of recommendations. Their aim is to improve the experience for the users by making application interfaces more intuitive, learnable, and consistent.</p></blockquote><p>Design systems are created to provide consistency and efficiency in the design process. They can help designers save time and reduce the risk of errors by providing pre-designed components, typography, color schemes, and other design elements. However, relying too heavily on a design system can limit a designer’s ability to explore and experiment with new ideas and approaches.</p><p>Additionally, design systems are often created to serve a broad range of products and use cases, which may not always align with the specific needs of individual users or products. Over-reliance on the design system can lead to a “one size fits all” approach that does not adequately address the unique needs of users or products.</p><h3 id="The-good"><a href="#The-good" class="headerlink" title="The good"></a>The good</h3><ol><li><p><strong>The elements of your design share a consistent language.</strong><br>A design system ensures consistency across all products, features, and touch-points, reducing the likelihood of errors or confusion. Changes made to the design system can be easily shared among components and pages, and duplication of work can be minimized.</p></li><li><p><strong>Faster development time due to design &#x2F; code parity.</strong><br>When design elements and codebase are tightly integrated, designers and developers are able to work together more efficiently and collaboratively, reducing the amount of time and effort required to implement designs. By using pre-designed components, patterns, and guidelines, teams can avoid reinventing the wheel for every feature they implement. This allows them to focus on the unique aspects of each design rather than wasting time on repetitive tasks.</p></li></ol><h3 id="The-bad"><a href="#The-bad" class="headerlink" title="The bad"></a>The bad</h3><ol><li><p><strong>The implementation of a design system can be time-consuming and costly, especially when trying to retrofit existing designs and systems.</strong><br>The most intensive part of building a custom system is designing the components that make up the system. Every interaction with your product matters, and the components must be designed with an eye for comprehension and ease of use. Fitt’s law compliant components react to user input in a multitude of ways to make a product feel more responsive. Moreover, special attention is given to making a user experience with each component a pleasure to use by adding small animations and transitions to every interaction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design system updates and changes can lead to compatibility issues and errors, requiring significant effort to resolve.</strong><br>To make the transition from design mockup to product code seamless, components are built in such a way that engineers can mimic all the changes designers could make. Styles are simple to update, thanks to a nested LESS architecture that makes wide-reaching changes easy. The design system’s breadth is also a crucial factor, as it provides a shared language of components that eliminates the need to reinvent the wheel every time a new project begins.</p><p>Remember a couple sentences ago when I said that one of the Good items about Design Systems is design &#x2F; code parity? In reality that pipe-dream is much more complicated problem to solve than it seems.<br>a. Unless you have a pipeline for directly publishing designs into your codebase, you’re going to take on the responsibility of checking that your designs have be correctly implemented in code. (As opposed to trusting a previously created &#x2F; vetted design library).</p></li></ol><h3 id="The-ugly"><a href="#The-ugly" class="headerlink" title="The ugly"></a>The ugly</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Design Systems can be an expensive, inescapable quagmire.</strong><br>Advocating for fixing design debts puts other feature work on the back-burner, and that is a big no-no for startups that rely on every feature to bring in a slew of new customers.</p><p>The final challenge revolves around making the user experience with each component a pleasure to use. To achieve this, small animations and transitions are added to every interaction. The Human Interest design system comes into its own when used to build interfaces. All the previous considerations and component design come together to create a cohesive experience, making it drag-and-drop simple to implement in production.</p></li><li><p><strong>Over-reliance on the design system can stifle creativity and innovation, leading to a generic and unremarkable user experience.</strong><br>It’s much harder than you think to convince leadership a design system is valuable.</p></li><li><p><strong>The strict adherence to a design system can make it difficult to accommodate unique user needs and preferences.</strong><br>Yes, it’s true that a lot of patterns solve a user’s problem <em>most</em> of the way. Bt how much more could you have solved it had you not decided to end your solution-seeking short by sticking to an existing pattern?</p></li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://vanschneider.com/blog/the-best-designers-are-artists/">via Tobias van Schneider:</a></p><blockquote><p>Not all designers are artists. In fact, most designers aren’t artists and that’s perfectly fine. But the best designers are indeed artists. And that’s the difference. For the most talented, successful designers in the industry, art is the secret ingredient that takes their work to the next level.</p></blockquote><p>This echoes my own feelings about recognizing the best designers.</p><p>Their approach to problem-solving is often rooted in their personal expression and creativity, and this humanity is apparent in their work. Artistry requires comfort in ambiguity, and those who are not confident in that space tend to rely solely on data to guide their decisions. This approach can result in underwhelming final products that lack the spark and personality of designs created by more intuitive and imaginative designers.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>In 2020, major architecture firms sent Autodesk an open letter that shook our leadership. Firms representing $22M+ in revenue cited our platform fragmentation as a critical failure, with some questioning Autodesk’s value entirely. The root cause? Our installation nightmare.</p><p>Enterprise IT administrators were managing 100+ separate installers, each with unique interfaces and configuration requirements. A single version mismatch could corrupt entire projects, forcing exact-match installations across complex workflows. One CAD manager told me: “We’re storing 12TB of installer files and spending more time managing installations than using the software.”</p><p>The business impact was staggering: $3-5M annually in duplicate development costs, 40-60% longer enterprise sales cycles, and mounting support tickets that overwhelmed our teams.</p><h2 id="Research-Discovery"><a href="#Research-Discovery" class="headerlink" title="Research &amp; Discovery"></a>Research &amp; Discovery</h2><p>I approached this challenge systematically, knowing that understanding the full scope was critical to finding the right solution.</p><p><strong>Pattern Inventory</strong>: I audited all 100+ installers, documenting every interface element and workflow. By creating Venn diagrams of functionality, I surfaced the repeat atoms—“licensing,” “paths,” “dependencies”—that appeared across products. This analysis revealed that despite surface differences, most installers were solving identical problems with slightly different implementations.</p><p><div class="carousel" aria-label="Media carousel">      <div class="carousel-track">        <div class="carousel-slide active"                       aria-hidden="false">            <img src="/2021/08/30/Custom-Install/000_customInstall.jpg"                                alt="Early research mapping installer patterns and workflows across Autodesk's product suite"                               loading="lazy"                               decoding="async">                      </div><div class="carousel-slide "                       aria-hidden="true">            <img src="/2021/08/30/Custom-Install/010_customInstall.jpg"                                alt="Legacy installer interfaces showing fragmented approaches to the same core functionality"                               loading="lazy"                               decoding="async">                      </div>      </div>              <div class="carousel-indicators">          <button class="carousel-button prev" aria-label="Previous slide"></button>                      <button class="indicator active"                     aria-label="Go to slide 1"></button>                      <button class="indicator "                     aria-label="Go to slide 2"></button>                    <button class="carousel-button next" aria-label="Next slide"></button>        </div>                </div></p><p><strong>Data Triangulation</strong>: I analyzed support logs, chat transcripts, and forum discussions, building PowerBI dashboards to identify where users were failing. The instrumentation data showed clear patterns: version mismatches, licensing errors, and extension conflicts accounted for 73% of installation failures. These became our leverage points.</p><p><strong>Regular Feedback Sessions</strong>: I established the “Delta Deployment Group”—a cohort of CAD administrators managing enterprise deployments. Every quarter, we’d workshop their workflows, and crucially, I’d show how their previous feedback had been incorporated. This transparency built trust and developed a shared mental model that helped me think like an IT administrator, not just a designer.</p><h2 id="The-Solution"><a href="#The-Solution" class="headerlink" title="The Solution"></a>The Solution</h2><p>The research insights led to a radical simplification: a unified web platform that generates custom installation interfaces from XML files. Product teams define their requirements in simple configuration files, and the system automatically generates consistent, powerful interfaces—no custom development required.</p><p>The platform introduced several breakthrough capabilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Multi-product intelligence</strong> that understands dependencies and installation sequences</li><li><strong>Cloud-based configuration library</strong> eliminating local storage needs entirely</li><li><strong>Shared configurations</strong> that turn individual solutions into organizational knowledge</li><li><strong>On-demand generation</strong> creating installers for any configuration combination instantly</li></ul><p><div class="carousel" aria-label="Media carousel">      <div class="carousel-track">        <div class="carousel-slide active"                       aria-hidden="false">            <img src="/2021/08/30/Custom-Install/011_customInstall.jpg"                                alt="Unified package library interface showing cloud-based configuration management"                               loading="lazy"                               decoding="async">                      </div><div class="carousel-slide "                       aria-hidden="true">            <img src="/2021/08/30/Custom-Install/012_customInstall.jpg"                                alt="Product selection interface with intelligent dependency resolution"                               loading="lazy"                               decoding="async">                      </div><div class="carousel-slide "                       aria-hidden="true">            <img src="/2021/08/30/Custom-Install/020_customInstall.jpg"                                alt="Advanced configuration options with collapsible sections for complex enterprise setups"                               loading="lazy"                               decoding="async">                      </div><div class="carousel-slide "                       aria-hidden="true">            <img src="/2021/08/30/Custom-Install/021_customInstall.jpg"                                alt="Version and language configuration interface streamlining deployment workflows"                               loading="lazy"                               decoding="async">                      </div><div class="carousel-slide "                       aria-hidden="true">            <img src="/2021/08/30/Custom-Install/030_customInstall.png"                                alt="Final platform architecture showing the complete transformation from fragmented to unified system"                               loading="lazy"                               decoding="async">                      </div>      </div>              <div class="carousel-indicators">          <button class="carousel-button prev" aria-label="Previous slide"></button>                      <button class="indicator active"                     aria-label="Go to slide 1"></button>                      <button class="indicator "                     aria-label="Go to slide 2"></button>                      <button class="indicator "                     aria-label="Go to slide 3"></button>                      <button class="indicator "                     aria-label="Go to slide 4"></button>                      <button class="indicator "                     aria-label="Go to slide 5"></button>                    <button class="carousel-button next" aria-label="Next slide"></button>        </div>                </div></p><p>The design focused on the three critical failure points our data identified: version management became automatic, licensing was centralized, and extensions were handled through dependency resolution.</p><h2 id="Results-Impact"><a href="#Results-Impact" class="headerlink" title="Results &amp; Impact"></a>Results &amp; Impact</h2><p>The numbers exceeded all projections:</p><ul><li><strong>90% reduction</strong> in deployment time (from hours to minutes)</li><li><strong>85% fewer</strong> installation-related support tickets</li><li><strong>30,000 packages</strong> created in the first 3 months</li><li><strong>11,000 returning users</strong> duplicating configurations</li><li><strong>$3-5M annual savings</strong> from unified development</li></ul><p>The platform launched in January 2020, becoming critical COVID infrastructure when teams went distributed overnight. It achieved complete adoption across Autodesk’s portfolio and directly addressed the Open Letter concerns about “lack of scalability and product performance.”</p><p>Our Delta Deployment Group became our biggest champions, with one member telling leadership: “This is the first time Autodesk has actually listened to us and delivered what we need, not what they think we need.”</p><h2 id="Reflection"><a href="#Reflection" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h2><p>Five years later, a Director of Product Management told me: “We’re still using your original designs and discovering new ways to leverage them.” This longevity validates my process-driven approach: deep research, continuous feedback, and data-informed decisions create solutions that stand the test of time.</p><p>This project transformed how I approach design challenges. The pattern inventory method became my go-to technique for finding simplification opportunities in complex systems. The Delta Deployment Group model showed me the power of building true partnerships with users, not just conducting occasional research.</p><p>Most importantly, I learned that solving fundamental infrastructure problems requires looking beyond the immediate scope. What started as an installer redesign became a platform transformation that saved millions and fundamentally changed how an entire industry deploys software. Beautiful design in utilitarian contexts doesn’t just differentiate—it rebuilds trust and demonstrates customer-centric thinking in spaces where users least expect it.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Installation-Nightmare"><a href="#The-Installation-Nightmare" class="headerlink" title="The Installation Nightmare"></a>The Installation Nightmare</h2><p>Autodesk users faced a deployment gauntlet that would break even the most patient professionals. Installing a complete workflow meant downloading and running dozens of separate installers—each with different interfaces, installation sequences, and customization options. CAD and BIM managers had to carefully orchestrate installation order because some products required specific plugins or shared components to be installed first, creating complex dependency chains that frequently broke.</p><p>Each product team had built their own installer over years of independent development, resulting in wildly inconsistent experiences. Users couldn’t install multiple products together, and each installer blocked productivity until completion. For professionals who needed Maya, AutoCAD, and Inventor for a single project, this meant hours of sequential installations and potential compatibility issues.</p><h2 id="Research-with-Real-Administrators"><a href="#Research-with-Real-Administrators" class="headerlink" title="Research with Real Administrators"></a>Research with Real Administrators</h2><p>Through quarterly sessions with a cohort of CAD administrators who volunteered for our research program, I developed a deep understanding of their daily frustrations. These professionals managed software deployments for entire organizations and had intimate knowledge of what broke, what worked, and what they desperately needed.</p><p>I shared mental model presentations and early design concepts with this group, documenting their needs and showing how requirements aligned across different organizations. This helped establish the holistic perspective needed to design for the entire ecosystem rather than individual products.</p><p>The research revealed a clear divide: most end users just wanted software to install cleanly and quickly, while administrators needed sophisticated control over configurations and deployments. This insight became fundamental to the design strategy.</p><h2 id="Designing-the-Framework"><a href="#Designing-the-Framework" class="headerlink" title="Designing the Framework"></a>Designing the Framework</h2><p>The breakthrough came from studying the macOS installer model and applying it to enterprise software. As shown in the interface demonstration, the final design presents users with a clean, minimal experience—the Maya installer shows just the essential legal agreement and a simple checkbox interface, with a streamlined “Next” button progression.</p><p>This simplicity was achieved by establishing clear boundaries: novice users would use the standalone installer with essential options only, while CAD and BIM administrators would be directed to the Custom Install web tool for complex configurations. This division allowed us to optimize each experience for its intended audience.</p><p>Working with engineering teams across six major products (AutoCAD, Maya, 3ds Max, Inventor, Revit, Fusion), I designed a framework that gave product teams controlled flexibility. They could choose their five essential options while conforming to the unified visual standard that aligned with Autodesk’s broader strategy of moving from distinct brand identities to one cohesive experience.</p><h2 id="Managing-Organizational-Complexity"><a href="#Managing-Organizational-Complexity" class="headerlink" title="Managing Organizational Complexity"></a>Managing Organizational Complexity</h2><p>The most challenging aspect wasn’t technical—it was navigating competing requirements from multiple organizations with conflicting goals. I used “disagree and commit” decision-making, documenting how I processed each team’s feedback so they understood their input wasn’t ignored, even when not implemented.</p><p>My presentations included slides showing “last time you told me this was a problem, here’s how I’ve addressed it over the past several months.” This transparency built trust and demonstrated that the design decisions were informed by their expertise rather than arbitrary design preferences.</p><p>The key was designing a framework that allowed teams to maintain some control while achieving our standardization goals. Product teams could still serve their unique user needs within the consistent structure.</p><h2 id="From-Chaos-to-Clarity"><a href="#From-Chaos-to-Clarity" class="headerlink" title="From Chaos to Clarity"></a>From Chaos to Clarity</h2><p>The transformation is visible in the streamlined interface—gone are the overwhelming option grids and product-specific branding, replaced by a clean experience that focuses on getting users to productivity quickly. Progressive loading technology allows applications to launch as soon as core components install, while extended features continue loading in the background.<br>The system eliminated complex dependency management that had plagued enterprise deployments. Multi-product installations became possible for the first time, with automatic sequencing ensuring compatibility across entire workflows.</p><p>Engineering teams were freed from maintaining separate installer codebases, allowing them to focus on core product development. The unified framework became critical infrastructure when COVID-19 forced organizations to deploy software to distributed home offices.</p><p>This project demonstrated that sophisticated enterprise software doesn’t require complex interfaces. By understanding user workflows, conducting thorough research with real administrators, and designing frameworks that balance control with consistency, we created an installation experience that felt consumer-grade while maintaining enterprise-level capability.</p>]]></content>

Project owners who could set up million-dollar construction workflows were forced to wait days for Autodesk staff to manually provision basic cloud infrastructure.</p><p>The process was frustrating and inefficient. Customers had to explain their project requirements through support tickets, wait for manual setup of teams and permissions, then hope everything was configured correctly for their specific regional and collaboration needs. Meanwhile, support teams spent countless hours on routine provisioning requests instead of solving actual technical problems.</p><p>This became particularly painful for large enterprises managing multiple concurrent projects. Every new building, every new team, every new collaboration workflow meant another support ticket and another delay in getting teams productive.</p><h2 id="Research-with-Real-Project-Owners"><a href="#Research-with-Real-Project-Owners" class="headerlink" title="Research with Real Project Owners"></a>Research with Real Project Owners</h2><p>I interviewed project owners and hub managers to understand how they actually thought about setting up new projects in the real world. These weren’t IT administrators—they were construction managers, architects, and project leads who knew exactly who needed access to what tools and what standards their teams should follow.</p><p>The research revealed that these professionals had sophisticated mental models about project organization, team permissions, and tool requirements. They could quickly determine which cloud products their project needed, what regions made sense for their teams, and what levels of access different collaborators required.</p><p>The bottleneck wasn’t their understanding—it was our process that forced them to translate their project knowledge through support tickets instead of letting them configure directly.</p><h2 id="Designing-Infrastructure-as-Self-Service"><a href="#Designing-Infrastructure-as-Self-Service" class="headerlink" title="Designing Infrastructure as Self-Service"></a>Designing Infrastructure as Self-Service</h2><p>The breakthrough was realizing that hub provisioning could follow the same self-service model that had worked for the Custom Install platform. Instead of forcing customers to describe their needs through support tickets, I designed a guided wizard that let them configure cloud infrastructure directly</p><p>The wizard walks users through the essential decisions: which cloud products their project needs, what geographic region makes sense for their teams, and how permissions should be structured. Behind the scenes, the system handles the complex process of setting up cloud instances, configuring team structures in Autodesk accounts, and establishing the technical infrastructure required for collaboration.</p><p>Working with engineering teams, I designed the interface to feel like project setup rather than technical configuration. Users think in terms of “I’m starting a new construction project and need these teams to collaborate” rather than “I need to provision cloud instances with these technical specifications.”</p><h2 id="From-Support-Dependency-to-Instant-Deployment"><a href="#From-Support-Dependency-to-Instant-Deployment" class="headerlink" title="From Support Dependency to Instant Deployment"></a>From Support Dependency to Instant Deployment</h2><p>The transformation eliminated the support ticket bottleneck entirely. Project owners can now provision new hubs instantly through the guided interface, with all the complex cloud infrastructure setup happening automatically in the background.</p><p>The wizard ensures that all the technical requirements—regional deployment, security configurations, team permission structures—are handled correctly while presenting users with straightforward project-focused choices. What previously required days of back-and-forth with support staff now happens in minutes through self-service.</p><p>Support teams were freed from routine provisioning requests to focus on genuine technical support issues. Customers gained immediate control over their project infrastructure, enabling them to respond quickly to new business opportunities without waiting for manual setup processes.</p><p>The system scales naturally with enterprise needs—large organizations can provision multiple hubs for complex project portfolios without creating proportional support burden. This infrastructure became essential as Autodesk’s cloud products expanded and more enterprises adopted collaborative workflows.</p><p>This project demonstrated how self-service design can transform operational bottlenecks into competitive advantages, giving customers immediate access to sophisticated cloud infrastructure while reducing support overhead.</p>]]></content>

The research revealed that the fragmentation wasn’t just inconvenient—it was creating real business problems as administrators struggled to maintain consistent access control and project organization across platforms.</p><p>The key insight was that administrators weren’t asking for more features; they were asking for coherent structure.

Instead of forcing administrators to understand the technical differences between products, the interface presented a unified view organized around projects, teams, and access levels.</p><p>I designed the permissions system to work consistently across all products while still respecting the unique requirements of different tools. This required close collaboration with engineering teams to create an abstraction layer that maintained flexibility while providing administrative simplicity.</p><h2 id="Implementation-Results"><a href="#Implementation-Results" class="headerlink" title="Implementation &amp; Results"></a>Implementation &amp; Results</h2><p>The Common Project Administration system transformed how enterprise customers managed their Autodesk cloud environments. Instead of juggling multiple interfaces and inconsistent permission systems, administrators could manage everything from a single, coherent dashboard.</p><p>The positive reception from enterprise customers validated the approach of designing around mental models rather than technical architecture. The system became the foundation for future cloud administration features across Autodesk’s product portfolio.</p>]]></content>

The startup had strong technical foundations but lacked the design maturity needed to win enterprise clients and scale operations.</p><p>Over 2.5 years, I led a comprehensive design transformation that touched every aspect of the company—from brand identity to product interfaces to the underlying design infrastructure. This case study documents that journey: how strategic design leadership helped transform Human Interest from an unknown startup into a recognized fintech leader.</p><h2 id="Chapter-1-Establishing-the-Foundation-Through-Brand"><a href="#Chapter-1-Establishing-the-Foundation-Through-Brand" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1: Establishing the Foundation Through Brand"></a>Chapter 1: Establishing the Foundation Through Brand</h2><p>The transformation began with a fundamental question: how could Human Interest differentiate itself in a market where trust and stability were paramount? Traditional 401(k) providers projected corporate gravitas through conservative design, but this approach wouldn’t help a startup stand out.</p><h3 id="Strategic-Brand-Development"><a href="#Strategic-Brand-Development" class="headerlink" title="Strategic Brand Development"></a>Strategic Brand Development</h3><p>Through extensive market research and stakeholder interviews, I identified an opportunity: humanizing retirement planning. While competitors focused on institutional messaging, Human Interest could own the emotional territory of helping people achieve their retirement dreams.</p><p>The logo design process resulted in a mark that symbolizes an unfolding map—representing Human Interest’s role in guiding clients toward financial security. The negative space artfully integrates the letters “H” and “I”, creating a memorable icon that works across digital and physical applications.</p><div class="carousel" aria-label="Media carousel">  <div class="carousel-track">    <div class="carousel-slide active" aria-hidden="false">      <img src="./brand-LOGO.jpg" alt="The refined Human Interest logo and typography system" loading="lazy" decoding="async">      <div class="carousel-caption">The refined Human Interest logo and typography system</div>    </div>    <div class="carousel-slide" aria-hidden="true">      <img src="./brand-booklet.jpeg" alt="Brand guidelines documentation establishing visual language" loading="lazy" decoding="async">      <div class="carousel-caption">Brand guidelines documentation establishing visual language</div>    </div>  </div>  <div class="carousel-indicators">    <button class="carousel-button prev" aria-label="Previous slide"></button>    <button class="indicator active" aria-label="Go to slide 1"></button>    <button class="indicator" aria-label="Go to slide 2"></button>    <button class="carousel-button next" aria-label="Next slide"></button>  </div></div><h3 id="Comprehensive-Visual-System"><a href="#Comprehensive-Visual-System" class="headerlink" title="Comprehensive Visual System"></a>Comprehensive Visual System</h3><p>I developed a complete visual identity system that balanced approachability with financial credibility:</p><ul><li><strong>Color palette</strong>: Bright accents against generous white space, adaptable for different user contexts</li><li><strong>Typography</strong>: Clean, modern system prioritizing legibility for financial data</li><li><strong>Photography</strong>: Real people in authentic moments, avoiding corporate stock imagery</li><li><strong>Voice &amp; tone</strong>: Conversational yet knowledgeable, making complex topics accessible</li></ul><h3 id="Environmental-Cultural-Impact"><a href="#Environmental-Cultural-Impact" class="headerlink" title="Environmental &amp; Cultural Impact"></a>Environmental &amp; Cultural Impact</h3><p>The rebrand extended beyond digital touchpoints into physical spaces.

The existing product suffered from fragmented experiences across three distinct user types, each with vastly different needs and sophistication levels.</p><h3 id="Understanding-the-User-Ecosystem"><a href="#Understanding-the-User-Ecosystem" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the User Ecosystem"></a>Understanding the User Ecosystem</h3><p>Through extensive research, I mapped three primary user personas:</p><ol><li><strong>Employees</strong>: Seeking simple retirement guidance without financial jargon</li><li><strong>Plan Administrators</strong>: Needing sophisticated tools comparable to Bloomberg terminals</li><li><strong>Operations Teams</strong>: Requiring comprehensive dashboards for multi-client management</li></ol><p>Each audience struggled with the existing interface for different reasons. Employees found it intimidating, administrators lacked necessary functionality, and operations teams couldn’t efficiently manage workflows.</p><div class="carousel" aria-label="Media carousel">  <div class="carousel-track">    <div class="carousel-slide active" aria-hidden="false">      <img src="./brand-redesignedAdminProduct.png" alt="Reimagined 401(k) administration platform interface" loading="lazy" decoding="async">      <div class="carousel-caption">Reimagined 401(k) administration platform interface</div>    </div>  </div></div><h3 id="The-Fauxdal-Innovation"><a href="#The-Fauxdal-Innovation" class="headerlink" title="The Fauxdal Innovation"></a>The Fauxdal Innovation</h3><p>The breakthrough came with the “fauxdal” pattern—a full-screen interface with centered modal and vertical progress indicator that transforms complex 401(k) paperwork into guided digital experiences. Similar to DocuSign’s document navigation, but without ever showing actual forms until completion when all answers are automatically populated.</p><p>This pattern solved critical user problems:</p><ul><li>Reduced form abandonment by 75% through progressive disclosure</li><li>Ensured compliance without intimidating legal text walls</li><li>Prevented errors through step-by-step validation</li><li>Built user confidence with clear progress indicators</li><li>Enabled conditional logic for personalized workflows</li></ul><p>The fauxdal became our signature interaction pattern, essential for complex financial workflows where traditional forms would overwhelm users or create compliance risks.</p><h2 id="Chapter-3-Scaling-Through-the-Foreground-Design-System"><a href="#Chapter-3-Scaling-Through-the-Foreground-Design-System" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 3: Scaling Through the Foreground Design System"></a>Chapter 3: Scaling Through the Foreground Design System</h2><p>By 2018, Human Interest was experiencing rapid growth. The rebrand had established market presence, and the redesigned products were winning enterprise clients. However, a new challenge emerged: scaling design across a growing engineering team while maintaining quality and consistency.</p><h3 id="The-Velocity-Problem"><a href="#The-Velocity-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Velocity Problem"></a>The Velocity Problem</h3><p>Our technical debt was crushing development velocity:</p><ul><li>Over 50% of engineering time spent customizing components for each feature</li><li>Inconsistent implementations creating support burden</li><li>Design reviews becoming bottlenecks for every release</li><li>Three different user experiences diverging without unified patterns</li></ul><p>I recognized that sustainable growth required more than good design—it required design infrastructure.</p><h3 id="Building-Foreground"><a href="#Building-Foreground" class="headerlink" title="Building Foreground"></a>Building Foreground</h3><p>The Foreground design system wasn’t just a component library; it was a comprehensive solution for autonomous engineering implementation.

The architecture prevented inconsistent implementation while preserving necessary flexibility.</p><h3 id="Measuring-System-Impact"><a href="#Measuring-System-Impact" class="headerlink" title="Measuring System Impact"></a>Measuring System Impact</h3><p>The results validated the approach:</p><ul><li><strong>90% reduction</strong> in UI confusion support calls</li><li><strong>Engineering time on implementation dropped from 50% to 10%</strong></li><li><strong>Feature velocity increased 3x</strong> with consistent quality</li><li><strong>Design team stayed lean</strong> despite company growth</li></ul><p>Brand New - Under Consideration featured Foreground as an example of effective financial services design, recognizing how it balanced sophistication with accessibility.</p><h2 id="Lasting-Impact-and-Lessons-Learned"><a href="#Lasting-Impact-and-Lessons-Learned" class="headerlink" title="Lasting Impact and Lessons Learned"></a>Lasting Impact and Lessons Learned</h2><p>This comprehensive design transformation—from brand to product to system—established Human Interest as a credible player in the enterprise 401(k) market. The company grew from startup to growth stage, eventually reaching unicorn status.</p><p>Key lessons from this journey:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Design leadership extends beyond pixels</strong>: Strategic thinking about brand, product, and infrastructure creates compounding value</p></li><li><p><strong>Domain expertise matters</strong>: The fauxdal pattern and financial iconography succeeded because they solved specific 401(k) industry problems</p></li><li><p><strong>Systems enable scale</strong>: Foreground allowed a solo designer to support an entire engineering organization</p></li><li><p><strong>User diversity demands flexibility</strong>: One-size-fits-all doesn’t work when users range from first-time savers to financial professionals</p></li></ol><p>The fauxdal pattern and custom financial iconography became company standards that continue enabling rapid feature development while maintaining quality across vastly different user sophistication levels. This work proved that in complex domains like financial services, thoughtful design leadership can transform not just products, but entire companies.</p>]]></content>

This project covers the end-user experience—making it effortless for users to schedule appointments with their case managers or doctors, seamlessly accept calls, and navigate sensitive topics through a positive, reassuring visual approach. The challenge was to create an interface that demystifies the process and instills clarity and empathy from the very first interaction.</p><h2 id="Process-Key-Findings"><a href="#Process-Key-Findings" class="headerlink" title="Process &amp; Key Findings"></a>Process &amp; Key Findings</h2><p>Working closely with Lyra’s leadership, I dove into competitive analysis and conducted user interviews and feedback sessions. These efforts uncovered some crucial insights:</p><ul><li><strong>Accessibility &amp; Privacy:</strong> Users demanded discreet, on-demand support that assured them of complete privacy.</li><li><strong>Streamlined Onboarding:</strong> Feedback pointed to the frustration of finding the right provider, underlining the need for a seamless, guided onboarding experience.</li><li><strong>Emotional Tone:</strong> The design had to balance warmth and professionalism, ensuring that the platform felt both inviting and trustworthy.</li></ul><h2 id="Design-Execution"><a href="#Design-Execution" class="headerlink" title="Design &amp; Execution"></a>Design &amp; Execution</h2><p>Guided by these insights and early leadership input, I developed a prototype focused exclusively on the end-user experience.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Understanding-the-Operations-Burden"><a href="#Understanding-the-Operations-Burden" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Operations Burden"></a>Understanding the Operations Burden</h2><p>When I joined Human Interest as their first full-time designer, I discovered that our 401(k) setup process was entirely manual. Operations staff would get on phone calls with customers, walk them through complex requirements, and send bespoke email links to one-off forms. Every single customer required individual attention, and with constant operations team turnover, we were burning enormous amounts of time on repetitive status updates.</p><p>I spent weeks shadowing operations staff and plan administrators, studying their workflows in forensic detail. What did each field accomplish? How did information flow between systems? When did customers get confused or drop off? I treated these real-world business problems as interface design challenges that could be solved through better UI and automation.</p><p>The frustration was palpable. Customers had no visibility into where they stood in the multi-week process, so they’d call asking “What’s the status?” Operations would spend hours each day fielding these calls instead of moving new customers through the pipeline.</p><h2 id="Designing-Transparency-Into-Chaos"><a href="#Designing-Transparency-Into-Chaos" class="headerlink" title="Designing Transparency Into Chaos"></a>Designing Transparency Into Chaos</h2><p>The breakthrough was realizing that 401(k) setup complexity couldn’t be eliminated—but it could be made transparent. I designed a card-based system where each step in the process became a visual task that customers could see and understand.</p><p>The cards unlocked progressively based on where customers were in the process. Some required customer action, others showed external processing steps like government approvals. The key insight was that people don’t mind waiting when they understand why they’re waiting and what happens next.</p><p>Working directly with our senior engineer and a junior engineer who had strong UI skills, we built a system where operations could remotely toggle flags to enable or disable steps for specific customers. This gave our team control over the experience while customers maintained visibility into their progress.</p><h2 id="Crafting-a-Premium-Experience"><a href="#Crafting-a-Premium-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Crafting a Premium Experience"></a>Crafting a Premium Experience</h2><p>This wasn’t just functional—it was crafted. We added animations, sophisticated styling, and proactive notification systems that made the complex process feel premium rather than bureaucratic. The goal was to reinforce Human Interest’s “white glove” positioning by making 401(k) setup feel as polished as any consumer product.</p><p>Operations got their own status dashboard showing where every customer stood in the onboarding process. Instead of customers calling to check status, operations could proactively reach out when someone stalled or needed attention.</p><h2 id="The-Ultimate-Validation"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Validation" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Validation"></a>The Ultimate Validation</h2><p>The impact was immediate. Support call volume dropped dramatically as customers could finally see their progress without calling. Customer satisfaction improved, and the onboarding experience became a genuine competitive differentiator in an industry that typically prioritized large businesses over the small and medium companies we served.</p><p>This tool proved we’d solved something universal: how to make complex, multi-step workflows transparent and manageable for customers while giving operations teams the control they needed to deliver exceptional service.</p><p><em>Fun Fact: The onboarding experience was so intuitive and effective that during a team meeting, our operations manager mentioned a customer had actually asked if they could license the tool for their own product—the ultimate validation that we’d solved a universal problem with workflow transparency.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Opportunity"><a href="#Opportunity" class="headerlink" title="Opportunity"></a>Opportunity</h2><p>As the inaugural designer for Common Cents Lab—a nonprofit at the forefront of advancing behavioral science research and education—I faced the unique challenge of rapidly establishing a brand identity from scratch. With no pre-existing visual framework, my task was to craft a cohesive and compelling visual language that seamlessly extended across the website, social media channels, and print materials. This foundational work was designed not only to encapsulate the organization’s mission but also to deepen the audience’s understanding of the financial challenges it seeks to address.</p><h2 id="Design-Execution"><a href="#Design-Execution" class="headerlink" title="Design &amp; Execution"></a>Design &amp; Execution</h2><p>Working independently, I anchored the brand identity around a single, powerful metaphor: a lens. This symbol of clarity and focus invites viewers to zoom in on the nuances of financial behavior. Each design choice—from typography to color palette—was purposefully crafted to reinforce this idea. The result is a streamlined, engaging brand system that transforms complex data into an accessible narrative, seamlessly bridging digital and print mediums.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Research-Cultural-Understanding"><a href="#Research-Cultural-Understanding" class="headerlink" title="Research &amp; Cultural Understanding"></a>Research &amp; Cultural Understanding</h2><p>Working with Miti Health (now Maisha Meds) in 2014 required deep understanding of how rural Kenyan pharmacies actually operated. Through photo documentation and field research, I discovered that pharmacists had developed sophisticated paper-based systems that worked efficiently within their environment.</p><p>The key insight was that these weren’t outdated methods—they were optimized workflows that had evolved to meet specific needs. Any digital solution needed to respect and enhance these existing patterns rather than forcing completely new behaviors.</p><h2 id="Design-Process-Implementation"><a href="#Design-Process-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Design Process &amp; Implementation"></a>Design Process &amp; Implementation</h2><p>I conducted a comprehensive UX audit while reviewing extensive photo documentation of pharmacists at work. This research revealed the importance of desk-based organization and the tactile nature of their information management systems.</p><p>The design process focused on translating rather than replacing these workflows. Instead of asking pharmacists to learn new digital paradigms, I created interfaces that felt like natural extensions of their paper-based expertise.</p><h2 id="User-Experience-Innovation"><a href="#User-Experience-Innovation" class="headerlink" title="User Experience Innovation"></a>User Experience Innovation</h2><p>The breakthrough was understanding that digital adoption in this context wasn’t about modernization—it was about enhancement. The interface needed to feel familiar while providing the advantages of digital systems: backup, searching, reporting, and connectivity.</p><p>By incorporating visual elements reminiscent of traditional forms and maintaining the logical structure of desk-based workflows, the digital system became a tool that amplified existing expertise rather than replacing it.</p><h2 id="Impact-Validation"><a href="#Impact-Validation" class="headerlink" title="Impact &amp; Validation"></a>Impact &amp; Validation</h2><p>Field feedback confirmed the approach’s effectiveness. Pharmacists described the redesigned interface as intuitive and familiar, validating the strategy of building bridges between physical and digital workflows rather than creating entirely new patterns.</p><p>This project demonstrated that successful technology adoption in traditional environments requires respect for existing expertise and careful translation of proven workflows into digital advantages.</p>]]></content>
