# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Hexo-powered static blog and portfolio site for Thomas Walichiewicz. Hexo converts Markdown posts into a static website with a custom theme called "san-diego".

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run server          # Start local server on port 4000
npm run build          # Clean and generate static site
npm run build:prod     # Production build with optimizations

# Deployment
npm run deploy         # Deploy to GitHub Pages

# Code Quality
npm run lint:scss      # Lint SCSS files
npm run lint:scss:fix  # Auto-fix SCSS issues

# Optimization
npm run optimize:images # Optimize images in source/_posts/
npm run analyze        # Analyze build size
```

## Architecture & Key Concepts

### Content Management
- **Posts**: Markdown files in `source/_posts/` become blog/portfolio entries
- **Scaffolds**: Templates in `scaffolds/` for creating new content:
  - `blog-post.md` - Standard blog post
  - `portfolio-post.md` - Portfolio project with gallery
  - `draft.md` - Unpublished draft
  - `case-study.md` - Detailed case studies
  - `page.md` - Static pages

### Theme System
The custom "san-diego" theme (`themes/san-diego/`) consists of:
- **Templates**: EJS files in `layout/` for page structures
- **Styles**: SCSS in `source/styles/` with modular architecture
- **JavaScript**: Modular JS in `source/js/` for interactions
- **Scripts**: Build-time scripts in `scripts/` for processing

### Build Pipeline
1. **Hexo Generation**: Converts Markdown to HTML
2. **Asset Processing**: Custom minification script (`scripts/minify-assets.js`)
3. **Image Optimization**: Sharp.js processes images (`tools/optimize-images.js`)
4. **Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow to GitHub Pages

### Key Features Implementation
1. **Project Gallery**: Uses `project_gallery.ejs` with multiple layout modes
2. **Adaptive Videos**: Automatic video format conversion for web compatibility
3. **Image Optimization**: Sharp.js processes images on build
4. **Dark/Light Mode**: CSS custom properties with JavaScript toggle
5. **Performance**: Lazy loading, minification, and caching strategies
6. **Remote Editor**: Secure blog editor in `tools/blog-editor/` with GitHub OAuth

### Deployment Pipeline
GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/optimize-and-deploy.yml`):
1. Triggers on push to main
2. Runs image optimization
3. Builds production site
4. Deploys to GitHub Pages with custom domain (thomas.design)

## Testing & Quality Assurance

Before making changes, consult `TESTING-PROTOCOLS.md` for:
- Change classification system (ðŸŸ¢ Green / ðŸŸ¡ Yellow / ðŸ”´ Red light)
- Required testing procedures based on change type
- Design review requirements for visual changes
- Screenshot and visual regression testing protocols

**Key principle**: Like a professional kitchen, all visual changes above a certain threshold need chef review before going out.

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT RULE ðŸš¨
**ALWAYS run `npm run build` before committing ANY changes**
- If build fails â†’ DO NOT commit or push
- Fix all errors first
- This is a hard blocker - no exceptions
- Test locally before deployment

## Important Patterns

### Creating New Content
```bash
# New blog post
hexo new blog-post "Post Title"

# New portfolio project
hexo new portfolio-post "Project Name"

# New case study
hexo new case-study "Study Title"
```

### Working with Images
- Place images in post folders: `source/_posts/post-name/`
- Use relative paths in Markdown: `![Alt text](./image.jpg)`
- Images are automatically optimized during build
- Small files (<10KB) are skipped from optimization

### Video Guidelines
- Supported formats: MP4, WebM
- Place in post folders alongside images
- Use adaptive video component for responsive playback
- Different aspect ratios for various grid layouts

### SCSS Architecture
- Variables in `_variables.scss`
- Component styles in individual files (e.g., `_project.scss`)
- Responsive breakpoints in `_device-breakpoints.scss`
- Theme modes in `theme-modes/` directory

## Performance Considerations
- All images are automatically compressed with Sharp.js
- HTML/CSS/JS are minified in production builds
- Lazy loading is implemented for images and videos
- Font loading is optimized with font-display: swap
- Build size analysis available via `npm run analyze`

## Anchor Links Implementation

### How Anchor Links Work
- Anchor links allow navigation to specific posts using hash fragments (e.g., `#post-Play-Next`)
- The anchor link handler is in `themes/san-diego/source/js/anchor-links-simple.js`
- Uses native `scrollIntoView()` method for smooth scrolling
- Automatically switches between blog/portfolio tabs if needed

### Creating Anchor Links
- Post IDs are generated from the filename: `Post-Name.md` becomes `#post-Post-Name`
- Link format in Markdown: `[Link text](#post-Post-Name)`
- The ID is case-sensitive and must match the filename exactly

### Important Notes
- Posts marked with `draft: true` won't be published and anchor links to them will fail
- Link posts with `short: true` are rendered inline on the homepage
- The script handles both mobile and desktop scrolling contexts

## Carousel & Spotlight Feature

### Overview
The carousel component supports both images and videos, with an integrated spotlight modal for full-screen viewing. When users click on any carousel media, it opens in a spotlight modal with navigation controls.

### Key Features
- **Mixed Media Support**: Carousels can contain both images and videos
- **Spotlight Modal**: Click any carousel item to view it full-screen
- **Navigation Controls**: Previous/next buttons and keyboard navigation (arrow keys, escape)
- **Indicator Dots**: Visual indicators showing current position and allowing direct navigation
- **Video Support**: Videos are displayed with controls in spotlight mode
- **Touch Support**: Swipe gestures on mobile devices

### Implementation Details
The carousel system (`themes/san-diego/source/js/carousel.js`) tracks all media items in a `carouselImages` array that includes:
- Images: stored with their src, alt text, and slide index
- Videos: stored with their poster image (if available) or a placeholder

When opening spotlight mode:
1. The current media item is displayed (image or video with controls)
2. Navigation indicators appear if there are multiple items
3. Users can navigate using buttons, indicators, keyboard, or swipe gestures
4. Videos autoplay with controls visible

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Missing Indicators**: Usually caused by the carousel not detecting all media items. The system now automatically re-scans for media when opening spotlight
- **Mixed Media**: Carousels with both videos and images now correctly count all items for navigation
- **Dynamic Content**: Project galleries loaded via AJAX are handled with delayed initialization

## Known Technical Debt

### 1. HTML Size Limitation
- **Issue**: When too many posts have `short: true`, the generated index.html can become very large
- **Impact**: Previously caused HTML truncation at ~138KB, breaking functionality
- **Current Fix**: Strip script/style tags from inline post content in `blog-posts.ejs`
- **Proper Solution**: Implement pagination (change `per_page: 0` to a reasonable number in `_config.yml`)

### 2. Duplicate Scroll Implementations
- **Issue**: Multiple files implement similar scroll functionality
- **Files**: `scroll.js`, `blog.js`, and `anchor-links-simple.js`
- **Impact**: Potential conflicts and maintenance overhead
- **Solution**: Consolidate scroll logic into a single utility module

### 3. Event Handler Conflicts
- **Issue**: Multiple scripts attach click handlers to anchor links
- **Current Fix**: Use capture phase in anchor-links-simple.js to intercept first
- **Proper Solution**: Implement a central event delegation system

### 4. Script Loading Order Dependencies
- **Issue**: Some scripts depend on others being loaded first (e.g., mobileTabs)
- **Impact**: Race conditions can cause features to fail intermittently
- **Solution**: Implement proper module system or use dynamic imports

### 5. Deprecated Sass API Warnings
- **Issue**: Build process shows "legacy-js-api" deprecation warnings
- **Impact**: Will break when Dart Sass 2.0.0 is released
- **Solution**: Update build configuration to use modern Sass API

### 6. Missing Error Handling
- **Issue**: Many scripts don't handle edge cases (missing elements, network failures)
- **Impact**: Silent failures that are hard to debug
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

```

## Component Library System (Added June 2025)

### Overview
A custom micro-component library has been implemented to provide consistent, reusable UI components across the site. This system is built specifically for Hexo and provides a foundation for migrating away from scattered component implementations.

### Architecture

#### Directory Structure
```
themes/san-diego/source/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js              # Main JS entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ index.scss            # Main SCSS entry point  
â”œâ”€â”€ utilities/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base-component.js # Base class for all components
â”œâ”€â”€ tokens/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _design-tokens.scss # Design system tokens
â””â”€â”€ core/
    â””â”€â”€ button/          # Example component
        â”œâ”€â”€ button.js    # Component logic
        â”œâ”€â”€ button.scss  # Component styles
        â””â”€â”€ button.ejs   # Component template
```

#### Integration
- **Styles**: Imported in `styles.scss` as `@use '../components/index' as component-lib;`
- **Scripts**: Components auto-initialize via `data-component` attribute
- **Templates**: Use EJS includes with relative paths

### Design Tokens
Extended from existing variables with component-specific values:
```scss
// Spacing scale
$spacing-scale: (
  'xs': 0.25rem,  // 4px
  'sm': 0.5rem,   // 8px
  'md': 1rem,     // 16px
  'lg': 1.5rem,   // 24px
  'xl': 2rem,     // 32px
  'xxl': 3rem     // 48px
);

// Component-specific tokens
$component-heights: (
  'sm': 32px,
  'md': 40px,
  'lg': 48px
);
```

### Creating New Components

1. **Create component directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p themes/san-diego/source/components/core/[component-name]
   ```

2. **Add three files**:
   - `[component-name].js` - Extends BaseComponent class
   - `[component-name].scss` - Uses design tokens
   - `[component-name].ejs` - Template with options

3. **Import styles** in `components/index.scss`:
   ```scss
   @use 'core/[component-name]/[component-name]';
   ```

4. **Use in templates**:
   ```ejs
   <%- include('../../source/components/core/[component-name]/[component-name]', {
     // component options
   }) %>
   ```

### Button Component Example

The button component demonstrates the pattern:

```javascript
// Auto-initialization
<button class="btn btn--primary" data-component="button" data-ripple="true">
  Click me
</button>

// EJS include
<%- include('../../source/components/core/button/button', {
  text: 'Click me',
  variant: 'primary',
  size: 'md',
  icon: { name: 'arrow-right', position: 'end' },
  attributes: { onclick: 'handleClick()' }
}) %>
```

Available variants: `default`, `primary`, `secondary`, `ghost`, `soft`
Available sizes: `sm`, `md`, `lg`

### Migration Strategy

1. **Identify components** to migrate (modals, cards, inputs)
2. **Create adapter functions** for backward compatibility
3. **Update templates** gradually to use new components
4. **Remove old implementations** once migrated

### Important Notes

- **Namespace conflict**: Don't use `components` as namespace (already used by `_components.scss`)
- **Auto-initialization**: Components with `data-component` attribute initialize automatically
- **Sound effects**: Integrated with existing sound system via `window.soundEffects`
- **Accessibility**: All components include ARIA attributes and keyboard support
- **Performance**: Uses event delegation and lazy initialization

## Environment Configuration

Two `.env.example` files show expected configurations:
- **Root level**: API keys, admin config, analytics
- **Blog editor** (`tools/blog-editor/.env.example`): GitHub OAuth, session secrets, paths

## Portfolio Organization

The `_config.yml` includes:
- Company ordering for portfolio grouping
- Year ranges for chronological organization
- Allows both company-based and time-based project views

## Working Patterns & Best Practices

### Parallel Worktree Development (Highly Effective!)
When tackling multiple technical debt items or parallel features:
1. **Create separate worktrees** for each concern: `git worktree add -b branch-name ../folder-name main`
2. **Run tests individually** in each worktree before integration
3. **Integrate systematically** from lowest to highest risk
4. **Use automated tests** between each merge
5. **Manual fallback** for complex conflicts - copy files individually if needed

See `docs/06-workflows/parallel-worktree-integration.md` for the complete workflow that successfully integrated 5 major technical debt fixes in one session.

### Visual Development Workflow
When working on UI changes:
1. **ALWAYS** take screenshots before making changes (Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4 on Mac)
2. Use the visual-testing protocols in `docs/02-development/visual-testing-guide.md`
3. Iterate on designs by comparing screenshots
4. For major changes, use `/project:visual-compare [component]` command

### Portfolio Improvement Checklist
When improving portfolio projects, ensure:
- âœ“ Clear problem statement and context
- âœ“ Research and insights documented  
- âœ“ Design process shown (sketches â†’ wireframes â†’ final)
- âœ“ Mobile designs included with responsive behavior
- âœ“ Metrics and measurable outcomes stated
- âœ“ Your specific role clarified vs team contributions
- âœ“ Technical implementation details where relevant
- âœ“ Lessons learned or reflections

### Performance First Approach
- Run `npm run analyze` after significant changes
- Check that images are optimized before committing
- Verify lazy loading works for new content  
- Monitor bundle sizes with each feature addition
- Use `/project:performance-audit [target]` for detailed analysis

### Git Workflow Best Practices
- Let Claude write detailed commit messages based on changes
- **ALWAYS** run `npm run build` before committing (no exceptions)
- Create PRs for significant changes using `gh pr create`
- Reference issues in commits: `fixes #123` or `relates to #456`
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`

### Quick Commands Reference
Custom commands available via `/project:`:
- `portfolio-improve [project-name]` - Enhance a portfolio case study
- `performance-audit [target]` - Run performance analysis
- `fix-tech-debt [issue]` - Address technical debt items
- `visual-compare [component]` - Create visual regression comparison

### Screenshot Tips
- **Mac screenshot to clipboard**: Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4
- **Paste into Claude**: Ctrl+V (NOT Cmd+V)
- **Full page screenshot**: Browser DevTools â†’ Cmd+Shift+P â†’ "Capture full size screenshot"
- **Multiple viewport testing**: Use browser responsive mode

### Effective Claude Usage Patterns
1. **Research First**: Ask Claude to explore and understand before coding
2. **Plan Before Implementation**: Request a plan, review it, then execute
3. **Iterate Visually**: Use screenshots for UI work
4. **Clear Context**: Use `/clear` between major task switches
5. **Leverage Subagents**: For complex research or verification tasks

## Lessons Learned & Development Insights (June 2025)

### CSS Architecture & Dark Mode Complexities
1. **Dark mode inheritance issues**: Variables like `$card-bg-dark` sometimes resolve to light colors (e.g., `hsl(0, 0%, 75%)` instead of expected dark values). Always verify computed values.
2. **Media query ordering matters**: Dark mode styles can be overridden by device-specific styles. Check specificity and cascade order.
3. **Use explicit RGB values**: When dark mode variables fail, use explicit `rgb(9, 9, 9)` for true black backgrounds.
4. **Border handling**: Setting borders to 0 on specific edges (right/bottom) creates unique visual effects and solves overflow issues.

### Mobile vs Desktop Styling Patterns
1. **Responsive padding differences**: Mobile often has different padding (12px vs 36px), affecting absolute positioning of child elements.
2. **Position context changes**: `.profile-header` padding varies between mobile/desktop, requiring careful absolute positioning calculations.
3. **!important flag usage**: Sometimes necessary for mobile-specific overrides, but use sparingly and document why.

### UI Component Enhancements (Latest Session)
1. **Search Clear Button Implementation**:
   - Added minimal clear button to search input that only shows when field has content
   - Position absolutely inside search-input-wrapper
   - No borders or box-shadows for clean appearance
   - Proper event handling with cleanup of previous listeners
   - Initialize on page load and dynamic content loads

2. **Button Style Standardization**:
   - Migrated Posts Only and Search buttons to outline style (transparent background)
   - Greyscale active states (black/white) instead of colored
   - Consistent hover opacity (30%) across all buttons
   - Dark mode text color set to hsl(0, 0%, 75%) for proper contrast

3. **Content Display Optimization**:
   - Non-interactive portfolio projects rendered as comma-separated text lists
   - Saves vertical space allowing more interactive projects to be visible
   - Uses `.no-writeup-list` class with transparent background and no borders
   - Maintains grid layout compatibility

4. **Sound Effect Integration**:
   - Posts Only button: plays small click sound (carousel button sound)
   - Search input: plays book sound on click
   - Impact/Contact modals: close buttons play appropriate sounds
   - Consistent audio feedback across UI interactions

5. **Border Radius Standardization**:
   - Updated all instances from 15px to 12px for consistency
   - Affects blog-content, portfolio items, and nested components
   - Creates more modern, cohesive visual appearance

### Sound System Integration
1. **Centralized sound management**: The site has a sophisticated sound system in `sound-effects.js` with preloading and helper functions.
2. **Audio format considerations**: Use .m4a for sound effects (not .mp3) for consistency and better compression.
3. **Event timing**: Play sounds at the beginning of event handlers for immediate feedback.
4. **Sound categories**: Different sounds for different actions (toggle, small click, button press).
5. **Helper function pattern**: Create dedicated functions like `playBookSound()` for new sounds.

### Portfolio Display Optimization
1. **Space-saving techniques**: Render non-interactive projects as comma-separated text lists instead of grid items.
2. **Content hierarchy**: Use "Other projects include:" prefix to clearly differentiate project types.
3. **Grid layout flexibility**: `grid-column: 1 / -1` spans full width, useful for special content blocks.
4. **Height constraints**: Match grid row heights (120px) even for text-only content.

### Button Design Evolution
1. **Outline style trend**: Moving from filled buttons to outline styles creates cleaner, more modern interfaces.
2. **Consistent hover states**: Greyscale hovers (30% opacity borders) work better than colored states for neutral UI.
3. **Active state contrast**: Black/white fills provide clear feedback without color dependency.
4. **Font consistency**: Matching font-size (12px) and weight (500) across related elements improves cohesion.
5. **Placeholder refinement**: 60% opacity provides optimal readability without being too prominent.

### Development Workflow Improvements
1. **Console.log cleanup**: Always remove debug statements before production. Use comments instead.
2. **Build verification**: Run `npm run build` after every significant change to catch issues early.
3. **SCSS linting**: Warnings about modern CSS notation aren't breaking but indicate future compatibility needs.
4. **Git diff review**: Always review changes before committing to catch unintended modifications.
5. **Comprehensive search**: When removing debug code, search all modified files systematically.

### Cross-Theme Compatibility
1. **Light/dark mode testing**: Every change needs verification in both themes - they often behave differently.
2. **Compromise solutions**: Sometimes perfect alignment in both themes isn't possible; find acceptable middle ground.
3. **Theme-specific overrides**: Occasionally necessary but try to minimize for maintainability.
4. **Explicit color values**: When theme variables produce unexpected results, use explicit RGB/HSL values.

### Performance Considerations
1. **Lazy loading preservation**: Ensure dynamic content changes don't break lazy loading functionality.
2. **Event delegation**: Better than individual listeners for dynamically loaded content.
3. **Build size monitoring**: Check that new features don't significantly increase bundle size.
4. **Sound preloading**: Preload audio files to ensure immediate playback on user interaction.

### User Experience Refinements
1. **Text overflow handling**: Multiple properties needed (`white-space`, `overflow`, `text-overflow`) to prevent button text cutoff.
2. **Touch targets**: Mobile buttons need adequate padding for comfortable tapping.
3. **Visual feedback**: Immediate sound feedback improves perceived responsiveness.
4. **Placeholder styling**: Consistent opacity across light/dark modes maintains visual hierarchy.
5. **Border radius consistency**: Updating from 15px to 12px across all components creates cohesion.

### Technical Debt Management
1. **Document known issues**: Add TODO comments for future fixes (like mobile button positioning).
2. **Incremental improvements**: Not everything needs perfect fixes immediately - functional is better than broken.
3. **Pattern recognition**: Similar issues (like console.logs) often appear in multiple files - search comprehensively.
4. **Testing strategy**: Manual testing still crucial for visual changes and interaction patterns.
5. **Priority assessment**: Low-priority issues (like positioning compromises) can be noted for future improvement.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
1. **User feedback integration**: "Don't be lazy" - be thorough with selectors and specificity.
2. **Iterative refinement**: Multiple attempts may be needed to get mobile styles right.
3. **Root cause analysis**: Variable inheritance issues require tracing through SCSS compilation.
4. **Pattern application**: Apply working patterns (like portfolio display) to similar problems.
5. **Clear communication**: Document what was changed and why for future reference.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL STYLING RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE ðŸš¨

### Respecting Boundaries and Constraints
**THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE**: When given a specific task with constraints, DO NOT make changes outside those boundaries.

#### Example of Boundary Violations to Avoid:
- User says "Projects are working fine" â†’ DO NOT modify project code
- User asks to fix scroll issues â†’ DO NOT change button colors
- User creates a file for scroll fixes â†’ DO NOT add styling to it
- User says "look at what works and apply that pattern" â†’ DO NOT change the working code

### File Purpose Boundaries
Each SCSS file has a specific purpose. NEVER cross these boundaries:
- `_dynamic-content-scroll-fix.scss`: ONLY for fixing scroll behavior, NO styling
- `_blog.scss`: Component styling for blog elements
- `_project.scss`: Component styling for project elements
- `_mobile-scroll-fix.scss`: Mobile-specific scroll fixes only

### Dynamic Back Button Styling
- **Location**: ONLY in `_blog.scss` (lines 802-859)
- **Background**: ALWAYS black in ALL modes (light/dark)
- **NEVER** add dynamic-back-button styling to any other file
- If you see white background rules for dynamic-back-button anywhere else, DELETE THEM

### Blog Content Dark Mode
- `.blog .blog-content` MUST have `background-color: rgb(9, 9, 9)` in dark mode
- This is defined in `_blog.scss` and `_dynamic-content-scroll-fix.scss`

### Project Edge Wrapper
- Must have `border-radius: 15px 0 0 0` (top-left only)
- Defined in `_project.scss`

### Dynamic Content Scroll Patterns
- **Projects work correctly**: They insert WITHOUT `.content-inner-wrapper`
- **Posts had issues**: They were wrapped in `.content-inner-wrapper` with overflow:hidden
- **Fix approach**: Use CSS to handle scroll, NOT JavaScript DOM manipulation
- **Understanding before action**: Study working patterns before implementing fixes

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Listen to explicit constraints**: If told not to touch something, DON'T
2. **Understand what works first**: Analyze working examples without modifying them
3. **Apply patterns, don't change originals**: Use working patterns to fix broken things
4. **Stay within scope**: Fix only what was asked, nothing more
5. **Use appropriate specificity**: Target precisely without !important spam
6. **Respect file organization**: Keep code in its designated location

### Red Flags That You're Going Off Track
- Adding styling to files meant for layout/behavior fixes
- Modifying code the user said was working correctly
- Using !important more than once or twice
- Making changes unrelated to the stated problem
- Ignoring explicit user corrections
- Assuming you know better than the user's constraints

### When User Says Something Works
- **DO**: Study it to understand the pattern
- **DO**: Apply that pattern to fix other things
- **DON'T**: Modify it
- **DON'T**: "Improve" it
- **DON'T**: Touch it at all

### Recovery When You've Gone Off Track
1. **Stop immediately** when corrected
2. **Revert changes** without argument
3. **Focus only** on the original request
4. **Ask for clarification** if constraints are unclear
5. **Never defend** unnecessary changes
